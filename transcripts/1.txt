the pomegranate what is a pomegranate chi said white tea of miss new deep otso hate action all right this writer is been first jacko podcast he rego i guess to start off how did we end up here how to this happen i guess i have to think o tempers for initially having me on to his pot cast and that was via a couple of people that helped me out get on their cupay peter a tea and they made some introductions and in a besme to tempters tim have me on god lotteree on that in that show and that led you me going on to jorian so thanksgivin for had me on his will and once those two things happened and i actually got on line and sorry given communicating with other human beings on mine and they were asking you know you should you should do a poncasars it was interest and both joe and tim told me to have a poast because it was interesting so as i got all that the back which was awesome um i can of realized that should you patas somesing here my name is jacob jackal willin i was a life don't know anything about me i served ten years in the military retired in two thousand ten myself and one of my buddies guided by name late fabens we started a company where we do leadership in management consulting for businesses do it all that work of any got us to a situation where we had some knowledge and kind of aggregated some knowledge and sile put that into a book the boat came out and been doing pretty well calderoni so that's the why i am now i kind of sometimes find it all strangers to be talking and so as we decided to put this upon cast gether at one point i have done some follow up videos for or tenteret on mine and i did those with a body mind who sitting here with me now gaberdine charles who is a long time you get your training partner mine and he does video production he's got a company called fixin t v and whenever i got to do something video related is a gotoku in sir when this came this opportunity gave about one we were filming of listithiel you we had questions from the internet and we were sitting here he foaming and we were basically doing a pot cast cause we were talking of it having conversations about leadership and about jugis in about problems in about everything and that kind of walden when we start talk about doing a poast i said he do you have all you equipment do you have a recorder do you have do you have time to said down and hang out with me and and do this and i do he said ideal the idea all that's stuck here we are so then now what we did was weak we took a bunch of ah questions that i got from all mine people had been with all kinds of different questions which is awesome thanks to everybody for giving me that feed back and listening and talking and communicate with me that awesome kind of weird because i i've never been like the most social person in the world and not that i feel like lonely because i never do i i don't care for a long eroticine online social effort on a flottant all mine social i mean i had to yeronner prior to you know being on the tempers poast noan um but but even socially i mean i don't like hang around with people you know what i righetti the last times over here is the way they i just don't do that a lot and so is it's kind of interesting to me being of an line and communicating with really thousands of people yea and they all and it's cold because i'm not used to having people that are kind interest in the same thing i'm interested in you know the jugeth working out the one to do better that want to get better the one alone more that's rita's what i want to do and it's cool be able to communicate with a bunch of people that want to do the same thing and you know i think that's what this potthast which i know is going to evolve into all kinds of different things but i think the the underlying theme will be lessons learnt you know lessons learned i want to learn from people i want people to i want to pass on what i've learned i don't want people to make the same mistakes i made i want to learn other mistakes of people's made so i don't make them and i think that's gonna kind of the underlying them here with us yea what about you i mean is there any thing in your back ground that you would consider to be important for people to know above him beyond what you just said no i nettamente relevant point or sureness as we talked about doing this that's one of the things that struck me as you're a director you know for your business or your you're a film director and you don't git in front of the camera that's not you say right and so that's why i think this interaction is good because you're you dropping out of people as what a director does yeh and i i believe that's where you're in edones less he wanted did of a lot of the metamora stuff that was essentially my nellie maybe a third of the whole job as she gets stuff out so the jugea out there if you followed metamora all the videos that the would they called led up videophone for the matches he those woloda ouleout douanes or achochre mattered there ye seetuation ally here his voice in the background with a question a so speaking a question yet we got to questions from the ah from the interweb now put out for the first here we first question is why do you wake up early in the morning actually this is a kind of have the same question in coushie up late or of the night club industry for a long time so my schedules i shifted it still you know work out and and and work hard for the most part during the day but my schedules as shifted but i think a lot of time time viewed as like all istikrita like early risers just to begin with kind of seem like these tis the plan in a but if you just ship the schedules it iowa you know you're for litigant hourly eye i yet less the nate orsepittle say that the tiplers ate eight hours sleep yes you get at arletta up at four thirty verses you get the same eight hours hours asleep seeing waking one hour or say ours awakened doing work and working to the sex but you wake up at in my case noon the cronies the difference really however bear tactically there is no etention of talk people that there on the night shift right you know sir they they get home at four clock in the morning if and but i think we both know parfaitlie we both know what the differences and i and i trelethin you know that waking up early now if that early means noon because you you work until seven o'clock in mimmering or eight o'clock in the morning and it takes dissipline to get out of bed then i believe that there's the tattine but if you wake up whenever you want and you slept for ten hours and your lazy get out of bed i think that effectual whole life in a negative way i really do i think it's not good um the anagan i know that some people are on those schedules in another some people need more sleep that's that's i understand that there are some genetic involved i have one of my daughters genetically i will go to bed at eleven o'clock at night she still awake i wake up at for in the morning she's awake so there's some genetic unweariness going on there ye what am as far as do getting up early but they what a high said agatha discipline to get out of bed wouldn't that kind indicate that may be needsome sleep goliasing of like what they hellitsh called the natural sleep side cycle right you go to sleep you sleep your horsemen i think idea seven and a half or somethin you naturally wake up you got your ass but if you if you do dragonet of ed don't that kind indicate any more rest possibly but you you said be right but you unholy say like um what do you say to a psychological victory sulga gratis it that kind it it's it's a mental exercise right yes so you're if that's part o your retentit adversity you end up getting better at fighting adversity whether it's that tiredness you feel or actual physical pain or ill and and also you sleep like with you decide to sleep more it's because it feels good right so right it then it's good for you but what if you want more candido know and none more candy because it taste good but that doesn't necessarily mean it to good and asatagon but i i do think that there's times that i do definitely need more sleep and but i don't and i also know that there's a fine mind i know when i get i know when i get over trained i know when i did not enough sleep and i feel it and my work out starts going back word and my judiciaria words and my life starts going a little bit backwards and then i know okay you know you you need to give you to take a day you needed relax sleep more may be like wake up it like five yes sleep into like five thirty and even donas tell that when we were training fighters for you have seen can tell when there when they reached their limit when they were over training it was so obviously would just fall apart on the mat just completely fallen on um and you the other thing is i am like making deal out of waking up early there's millions of people in the world that that's what their job is there a single mom and they go to work to jobs and they're getting up at earlier than i am in are going bad later than i am as there supporting a family so i'm not sitting here the same this is the ballena but i will say that i definitely it definitely hasn't impacted i definitely affect the other things in your life if you have that disappoint early in the morning at it it will help you across the board ye an i i always read this stuff about creative people and this is complete generalization but they say that creative people tend to stay up later and a in usually when you stalled you wake up later whatever em if you'll it if your manly weakens couldn't it be kinsin couldn't be seen at like when my early waking is a total lack of creativity to no it seems like it here you're driven to get things done in no get the job to get a young one well no excuses ri and at the same time develop your physical mental toughness and in improve yourself in the way that its essentially like i want to say the chores in life but saouy want to get up and maximise day get the most work done upon right so if you lets up yet ildak up an item i do my work i get home at five and i you know i kind of geoff watched them t v and may be i don't know maybe even go out to a bar or something like that where all bout the work is done doesna work to be done really as far as i just kenaina general was wisitin work to be done esteban work to be done watching you know t v or whatever so a person that lacks disciplined there good it's fighter barlaamo know for in a generous being am kepitel so there goin to be all focused on that i caught no want to go to bed and i in face the work day the next day i don't want to charge the work day i want a emerel it is in the fun part of it in the candy part of it then they wind up going to bed late and then they wind up having to drag themselves out a bit may be sleepin a little bit more so wouldn't can that discipline that you talk about that pie for the whole day not just waking up early to right so it's like old system so a lot of it a lot of people wouldn't like you that that i've noticed you focus really hard on getting stuff done and if you maximized the time you have to get it done in wake up early then you can do that moratin it and after some time i don't want to give the impression that i'm living this like cask driven life where i have every minute as the day scheduled because because then that does inhibit you ability to do other things have at your idiot you creativity and am obviously but you know trained you gito and i'm going to go there for maybe i'll just go there for forty five minutes and gets em round in maybe i'll be there for three hours and i don't necessarily know that when i show up because i have some flexibility and one of gonado in the day of the ways are good may abuse and you know the but you you're right dead you have to be disappointed not kitty on a bed is like the deep foundation of the discipline is and i think it carries over everything else because we get out of bed early and then you work out when i get them working out me personally i don't want to eat junk when i get done with all the like oh you know i do good work out in feeling good i'm feel healthy instead of eating a bowl of lucky charms i'm going to eat you know some some eggs and bacon and it something good so i agree with you on that um yes so i fear canbottle sighed note to to that question i well to me one of the things will people ask me like what drives you which is kind of a weird question cause it had big question raggett's not weird question is a big question relative yellon theses ye answers on noon for one of the things that i definitely think of it as a as a drive of me is his fear and it's you know fear a failure fear of being a ledge yes oh yes if what drives me mad and and this comes from arimanius was when i was a young eye then he will be mias very afraid of making mistakes and looking stupid or doing dumb fings getting a bad reputation and that fear got me to work early and dommedest my dear three more times and got my meeting asked my body to inspect my dear to make sure we were good to go so i i think that's what the furies and then there is also the fear of what the enemies doing and how arnarvatn and are you training harder than them and now that i'm inesilla world in thinking okay what is what is you know some other company doing better than we're doing and how can we overtake them you know and that's some weird fear and competitiveness that you know everybody has some people more than others you got a balance it for sure but it's definitely one of those things ye ye sometimes that can get in the way especially you mention that what is that other company doing so i knew this guy that my brother worked with that he would be one of those guys where he'd be really concerned and what's the whattamatter doing so he'd be dimelin this aspect of his company and it's like right in the middle of development or in what he detained to tell you no one ear would be on the in knowthat going on with this other company and they do some new thing or go in some new direction that really yield a love successful and all we got to do that we got a mean while these other ideas that are solid by bides are left half developed or or the resources are kind of allocated to do this new thing and that so much the old stone you know what i actually got as restored with a company of the day and they said you how much we be focused cause i said something along reason this is how was so we be focussed on what the enemy on what the competitors are doing and should we be afraid of them and i said actually fear is the wrong word to you shouldn't be afraid of the enemy but you have to respect them and i think that's the thing that gets me out of that neerly in the morning is that i respect the enemy i am out afraid of em but i respect them and i'm going to be ready to do battle with him when it is time come so you know this kind of a sight not but isn't it don't you can think too sometimes worth your almost like reflecting yourself when you say your four you respect and you for lacouture that enemy what they're doing a prepare because you know you're doing a prepare and is pretty hard so you kinda almost in the back your mind is thinking there probably doing it all this too you know so it's like the more you do the more you kindnesses is way might think vere doing their doing the same rain you know so it's like pombons never anything like a ooliganism horus someone yea and and if you get caught up in it to a point like the ample you just gave you i can drive you crazy and o'erveiled helen have to be able to stand on your own and and say i am well going to we're going to maneuver regardless of what the enemy's doing or going to make our we make our move ye next one we on next next question am all actualise lean other people think miriam i cannot went through that um yes is the discipline everyone who soundingly concept o k well then and you kind of talk about this before mental toughness how do you and this is not one that applies to me where sir an you see it even in in high level certain people it's almost like tate navigated their way through life and two into success not really needing that much mental toughness because the maybe they had some special attributes that allowed them to be successful early on and captinus these let athletes were not a moeragenes and in now any old you'd kind of notice it when things give it rough for em that's when they break or or whatever and am so i mean i'm not saying that my caserio hate or nothing like that but it just so happens in a lot of ways some way soever um i managed to avoid developing mental tuffnel about gatto years ago maybe um but and i i of course i know how mine came about i think i mean did the main reason was just through maturity and seen in her only but of its adinit i wasn't surrounded by people who are mentally toughenin see the value for an i would how he just develop mental suffragan this is one of those things that people as in this was a big question from all mine you know to and on apple asked how do you develop mental toughness how do you become more mentally tough and you know you and i did that video on it or its like if you want to be more mentally tough then be tougher he you know he and i and he hit his people that her out there that sell horses on developing mental toughness and you know they're either going to bring you into a room and get you into some spiritual state and say okay listen you've got you visual eyes the mind of the wolf and you are going to see through the eyes of the wolf what does it wolf to the wafers not back down elevate and there in a catheter okay i'd a matarengi right telecast because a copering about mental toughness is it's just a simple choice that you have to make are you going to go through with the thing that's hard this thing that though the thing that socks are going a suffer for it or you intuit it's really easy ye you you just go okay i'm going to talk through it i'm going to be with it then your medleth done next question let him gain a something more important you know what i mean that you and me doesn't that and may be wrong he bit that sounds like the answer come in from some one who has desnature but as the luxury of being mentally tough so if when you're a you do ever remember it then that you were not meant that you were straight a mentally weak you ever remember any time no as nineteen ninety six i was moulinee altepetl talk about infiltrating they say oh everybody everybody wants to cut at some point during seal training and i i literally not at all never for one second i think on em in a quite i don't want to do this any more not even a chance oh that's ridiculous em who says that she you'll say it lay on him say it at an absolutely all you know every one thinks about quitting sometime in the now and i got plenty of rose in the seal teams that never re fought about coinage saying we tethered a base hit not you don't get think about not to anything about quitting yes and so those guys are mentally togs and okay so he if you're not mentally tough if you've you yourself as manly weak then he got a do things i guess push yourself to that threshold and how do you pecherel that threshold you do manly challenging things you can physically challenge it in things and you push through ye then and in that my develop your mental toughness more ye you'd think that like one exercise getting the rats i need to get those raps of hard stuff mentally i like that seminar analogy just made that's not housethrift ever work no matter you your visualizing yourself as a wolf or wore whatever it you're not even getting the rats the like saying oh i've never played basketball ever i never been held about the bove would guess what we're goin to get to reprepared you to be good a basketball closerstil sed play basketball and that's your wraps jeff sir probably won't work so that back to the fear ornithae because all his people on deck not hesitate you get better at that's sure like you an you a unenterprising anal toftrees more of a motion than riding rivesaltes you know waning and in reacting instuments toughness he may be but it it won't substitute wraps like of your scare to something for example that should be like a flag or an indicated a okaionlonhsera right here i'm scared of this your right and that being said like you talking about your buddy your sealed batistet never organique right and i was definitely never goin to quit well i had have any wrap going into that of you know mentally challenging thing to whatever i mean why i didn't do in in life in my fit but this is this is why i say that i've not one obviously wasn't insulting so they might find that art to billy eeah no begueule football do you in school um they both one whom father was a navy seal and just grow a growing up a certain way with a certain deliere ment does make you do like lots you other did not leading you quit like a play he will out wonderful ball and you dad like now you you can't quit a you are an quitman good or its unsolicited my hurt or whatever it ill your dad say no you don't quit and it just is in your mytilene don't entered thing about the soul teams is there's kedaref in you know some rich town with very wealthy parents and went to an ivy leaf school and there tough and there's kids that go up with no dad then you know a single mom and the they're talisso that serious almost deep once because we're as that montelupo from it ignited lonesome from a bunch of different places that just is interpreted in kinistina eye in the same way and ollywell wheeler i think it comes from one where human being decides that they're going to achieve their goals and they're going to go through whatever of schools then that's where mental toughest contulit is a decision that human beings make to make it happen ye ye but i think that when you do let you do it right now i'll let yer sure heros fondevila or mental totalitarian and in narrow it down your ginerally basically say right now like you didn't give you work to elfinhart the mental catassin had every one else is fault that your fault is not tough and take the oath exact opposite of extreme nashola of mental to me formerly working on nobody i think i eat is a lot in batonmen factors he like you become tough because the certain environments for serai guess i guess we we would need to see what happens with the people that aren't mentally of it because where do they end up say in up in the gathered up dead they end up in jail they had up wenables because they weren't mentally tough that didn't figure it out that in drive through it and so we don't even know who those people are what happened to them they failed workmanlike make that decision deddn decide that there redet out of that bad as he ation they were to push through that scenario and the gusty played football with they drove through that those bad situations a got there no sir they did it they decided to do it yes yet making that decision i guess it's they would have that sort o access a place in their mind were that decision is final cause a lot of times people say you i'm no do this and that's my dream and you know i want be an architect and then when they go to college when they begin or classes three hours a day for five days there are well you know i don't know no that's one thing that the heel turning does very well is gets rid of this people that every one that shows up there thinks they want to be a sealight until you know he mantinian then you've got half the guys in the anup with twenty percent of the gossey one has that dream if they show up there yet but that game gets crushed so as the china maginary not built to do this but imagine yourself mentally knocked off downy one to say we just an average person you know when it'll when you get it you doing some push up so you hit about you know it dan you like ah you had twenty like kagemori so you stop doing the put shops and tergot the guy with going to get those fight extra you're not that god is there an exercise or in approach to just be on the past it it at least increased my mental tormental togalike what they like what cheating all at yatton away can't keep got you you can i mean i can yes yes you can not eifferent you an you just got to sit be okay i remember i read the small little book is called mind games and in it there is one short after an a one anger enrich like you have anger issue me and i'd never had angrisani ida but i like it it also young is like the one on through twenty four n get mad and i think i'm better than certain rules and when they get call out on the roof i pitch it let you know have an attitude or whatever it oh so i read this this little chapter and it said anger issues along with other things comes from a loaf self esteem because dere brisendine in your react you know young distress lay or whatever but the word low self esteem was like a truer for me so having a low self atene for whatever reason i thou as like an embarrassing thing so i set you no effect could be a little trigger so you could find little triggers in the say you know you did prosiliunt is more the fact that you don't want to do the five more that should be embarrassing to you ye no lie if you kind of tell yourself that that'll help you make that decision where i'm not going to embarrass myself right on you know so that fear of embarrassment in gito into the mode to to one exercise more mental toughness you know in a debt trigger and at the end of the day when you feel that weakness it's a choice to make the overcome at de not that big of a deal you just socket up and do it it's go to the next question he had initiated he mental and physical steps or patterns to stay on game yes is this is one of those questions that we got a very simpletons every some water a question of this water the five key if people was on put numbers on things these days i think people to let us in spanialand to see a list of loki i do this but i guess you know that's it sells i griha or the five in fact i've done abunail' about lay for i and they be they they throw like a number on him the welting the three eggs if um because people want to believe that there's a fine night a number of steps to take in a ulster an article for consumption it makes you feel mentally comfortable to know that okay it's not this oceanic a mitred i know i'm going to breed it twelve you know and and that's what i may eat you know a a you know it's going to go back though what we've already been talking about you know for me waking up early working out every day take an ownership of what you're doing and responsibility of things that are in your life am making sure that you periodically to out the day throughout the hour maybe not throughout the minute but that you detach yourself from the situation that you're in you detach yourself from it and look at yourself and you assess and i think that has a huge impact and i you know i talk about that lot that detachment that it it is something that i learned in this yieldin i learned it when bad things were happening and if you get sucked into those bad things and you're in them mentally emotionally and physically you can't assess well because you're in the problem it's like when you're watching harmonie and evolver like voluntarily you'll others a noise down in the basement let's go see what it is every one that's washing a movie that detached from the situation is screaming at the screen no don't do it the people that are there are saying yes let's go check it out here emotionally and physically and mentally in the situation so haven't the ability to detach from the steep present from being in insirted beneath him that is is usually important because it allows you to do a real assessment of yourself and then finally stayin humfley you you you can't ever think that you've got everything figured out eve got a constantly be saying you know what can i do better what can i fix what am i screwing up and people are going to give you advice and you go take it and listen to it and see it's good or not they be put it to the test but i think those things you know waking up really working out taking ownership of stuff being able to catch in a sass and stay at home rosalind of my main stay if i had to call him out on the list of five things and make you banter a yes yes the owner of the i don't i mean they're all pretty you know that these are all challenges for sure they aren't just easy things to do em but the ownership a thing that's a big key like um prisin your book what it talks about the whole theme of the book extreme ownership the where any situation when something goes wrong when it doesna you want it to go better to so easy sobresaliente emotionally charge or whatever it's so easy to be like movearis job or whatever in a lattice of it's true that i did have to as jooneer it and then when you do that you don't even think about or you don't honestly tell yourself i think about what what you did or what you didn't do you do what you did wrong you know to me that am you know to what role you played and that why that detachment is is critical because if you don't detach it's very easy to be in your own head say well echoed up his barnet's why we failed the mission is to cause accadent his job and now but as soon as i hear myself saying that when i'm saying it it's okay when it's coming on my mouth rarities saying if then i know that i have yeigh wrong way i know that i've made a mistake in it with interesting is when you when you and it's something you can do like right now you don't have to get trained in it you can start practicing taking ownership out of everything you possibly cap literally right now and what i found and i really like about it is that it works not just like with business or with everything relationships with your friends relations with your wife a girlfriend or boyfriend whatever all that works amazing in all this is situation short apis really conelike a stable for for life you know like a weight a conduct yourself dianalike you mate that is why that is why that became the title the book because that is the under lying characteristic that helps people in their life and if i mean taminas a leader of course obviously in a in a precure situation obviously in a business obviously but you're right in it it takes a transition sucrose the board to life and and it makes you successful crossboard when you take owners of everything no down about it now so at a forty four get out of bed but our as like the next mission is round the corner what drives you actually kind of talk about that kind of that fear of the enemy's for peration yea what do you you you know this is one of those things that when when people start talking about a war and what war does to people and you know nowadays were hearing and we see more than we know more about what war does to people's mind soon and obviously it is iana some some extremely negative embarks on people and there's a lot of veteran rihow that are that are suffering that are having a hard time and i think for me when i think about what drives me it's an extremely powerful force that driving me to day and that is that i served with guise that sacrificed their lives so that we could be here so that i could be here so that we could have freedom so i could have never mind freedom so i could be here alive and when you think about that when you think about this gift this gift that you've been given to comeback to america and be free and have a life and have liberty and an be free for the pursuit of happiness we think about the gift it's the most beautiful thing any one could ever give you it's been given you it's been given to me and i will not scorneth gift and i will make every day count as i remember those guys that gave back gift to me yet a funny how like you how you can get a glimpse of certain people's life and how they how they behave in on the act with the routine and schedules and them when you like kester that an you've said that before and and you even consistat to me before and it kind reminds you how much you are reminds me how much i'm not doing you know in the you know how if you get free money it is the one means less drive any you earn it now so i think it comes when you don't do a lot or you know maybe eating a you have in served to omelike that it's almost like free money and you've been exposed to earning that money and the intralles so that's buonconte tly just in your nature now and then you know other people they they do have to be reminded you know tiney you what a powerful reminder because every day and i would say every minute of every day i'm thinking about those guys and that that that's a that definitely pushes me and i emilet those guys down ye so in regard to the military um you don't officers entering speckots or other let enaros what advice would you have for them you know this is again this is one of those questions it's come up and i get this a lot because a lot of people that listened to jorogata lot of people that listen to tempers their younger folks and they um there they might be stepping in leadership leonforte first time and so we definitely got a lot of a lot of of questions for military guise that ergoing promoted third enrooted in the leadership positions and we get a lot of younger people better stepping into the business world and their supinely rolls for the first time in those situations and i think that on the aniwee voth live special operations folks and the folks in the business were all to the same thing because as if anyone's listen to me at all or heard anything that i say or read the book the leash principles do not change regardless as in business or in battle the leash principles state the same and so if you're now and your up and coming what do you do how do you step up into that roll number one be humble i know it's a theme i saw like a broken rout record but you everybody knows everybody see that cocky guide walks in and think they're going to run everything and yet you just instantly disrespect that person you how you overcome that you come in he behemoth people you don't you you you respect people regardless of what rank you are regardless of whether you're your making a ton more money than some one else it doesn't matter you treat everybody with respect you treat them with respect and they're going to respect you you listen to them it means so much winenne your people comes in talk to you and you sit down in a key let me take him not somewhat you're saying that means so much to them and sometimes people forget that you know they differed what it means to look up and and see the boss man and be they might below a guy offer you know had on avitor your anna you go listen to people because what you trying to do in a leadership position and this is a word that i've only recently become comfortable saying the word is relationships your truly and that that's what businesses that's what that's what life is that's what business is that's wood combat's that's how you lead people in combat in business you have relationships with him lay for italomania don't sure i can give you an order of you if you're belongina and you might do it some of the time but you're not going to the tethele that really fall you that you have a relationship with you this cassoni for you the guys that at that that i worked with it the guys that work for me or were my support it they do anything for me and you know what i would do anything for them only anything for those guys the guys that were in my task unite gotras they were awesome guys and i would do anything for those guys i would give them anything anything and they were do the same for me why because we had relationship we that was what we had it wasn't because i would orgar them to do some that doesn't work so you got a bill those relationships and how you build relationships how do you build relationship then you bilderatlos ips by one thinks by riseing people by being humble by listening i i come on the truth by having integrety untiling people the truth you can't why do people and at amy's a strong word because you'll i don't think people are generally lying to jenneral ar basis but people people use half truth said nay you know they shadow things in a can do that and people see right through it and he in they don't know what the truth is they know them or getting the truth we so you know i i was always with my guide okay here's what's going on here's the problem here is what we screwed up here's all we need to do better here's the pressure i under from irascatur here's why am under this pressure i'm not sure you conington not trying to set something up to be different am been what the reality is if i'm getting told to do something that i don't believe in okay now this is a cuff on if i'm getting told us a esometha i don't believe in i'm not going to go tell my guys hey i don't believe in this and we're going to do it anyway none o no no if i don't believe in it i have for you o why were going it animosa boss i do not understand why we're doing this pannenoisance help us in about so sightlines is to me so i can explain to my gossau i'm not going to go lightest giton then and say he will do in this any ways or or i'm not going to send people to do things that i don't believe it we'll trying a win the war my bosses trying to win the war i'm trying to win the war my goertin to win the war some my bosses in it to tell me do something to do make sense and dozen isn't watchin the war so i should believe in it and if i don't ponishet on him i and those are those of the things that a low you to build relationships in all the topic of the nighean ownership you know if you're if you take on her ship when the problem said you get himself and in when things jingle right you passed that pass the reward and the credit on to your boys then you that that also helps you build those relationships that's what i would tell a new leader in the business world war called you know fathead that one like number one or cartwheeling that's another thing that whole that whole answer with what you descend apisaon that applies to everything you even as you say as the leader you know in an theekit the chain of command and in ell you guys that works with your kids your friends or jussienne neal like you know have to jim if you're if i used to work with this guy and men he is the nicest di he was the nicest guyed always have compliments but you in compliments at a kind of two good like manet listinoise where on new shirtman that sure to foreordained never been told me a yiyantic up with a different one but he would do that kind he would say if you now give you compliments right just over do it a little bit too much just a little bit just a step outside of the room with it being believable to so a kind workhouse offense and then he won't you to walk away or whatever estheticians come back man ideas and awesome sure you it's hard to believe giving one o no about this person that you're that into your sure i sure you know it did just gave you jagoaretes that would be a thing if there was other indicators right so it's it's a whole person of so if it takes that it takes you being consistent and all these thing that you're saying honest and in rancon isten about it so so the point of your story is that you didn't build a relationship with a grand because you didn't trust a yes exactly right so you don't in your saint'll the truth you away it's if it's bad and totateeta inntinn this get leely it's almost like he would only one to tell you good news so it could be like he could it's almost like you had this feeling like eveniat ed my shirt i thought it looked lacerating i that am he would hostilities a cashuran you listening me to atoneton and that is a balance i talk about battant all the time because all these things have to be balanced and when you're talking about truth right now you have to be tactful you know being being truthful and being honest does not give you permission to be a jerk he adoze do that and so there's a difference between you know oh i don't like echo sure so minnesaenger righted just like when you work in with you know supporting and they screw something up your yourn that was a horrid won't job you you you let me down no no kay hey ho for all you want to nesubanebded give you ten of gutenburg both the point that i'm trying to make is being honest with people there's people that are belong honest leaders and everyone hates them because they are so born they don't have any tact they don't they don't maneuver they don't use you get they don't they don't think and he don't assess the whole situation and they think that if if i tell after you know if i want echo to use massed a and echoes used to move using mesabi echouee personality that if i go on say hey usato now i'm being blown on being frank whatdeelack delivering as all wonder that you ah no one do massed a i'm sick with my notes that's real i need to get used to you got you you've got to influence people you've got to be a chest play or not a checker player and so don't confuse being honest with being blunt and unpacked and a jerk you have to do to gibe and for any one that's listening the dozen du you git do you git is a very new wants to gain where your constantly trying to set things up and shape the situation it's not like boxing him boxing i'm trying to punch you your turn to punch me and you git your trying to manure the other person you're trying to get better positions on them your trying to flank them and come in from a different direction that they didn't expect that's what the the art of leadership is any one could go through a list of hay his what you guys screwed up on the mission one two three four five fix it that is knockin er you respect is a leader even though he's truthful and an honest and belong it's not going to get him here needs to be there's a whole nother gainsayeth and it's an it's in its dealing with eagles and its being with personalities that's really what it boils down to everyone has different personalities and learning how to be a craftsman that knows what tools to use with what different types the wood that's what being a leader is yes if leadership was duty's next seven things and you'll be a great leader i wouldn't have a book and i wouldn't have a business because every one would be a great leader there is an art to it it is a it is a very difficult thing to do its simple their simple steps you know be honest show show in taggerty take oder ship of his to simple steps but at the same time the incredibly new ones to it and that's what makes a challenging and that and that's what makes you so rewarding as well that is absolutely what makes it so rewarded people who don't people who don't take a conflict other don't take a conabitur one else uh how do you deal with belike that the animadversion ally how you deal with uncoachable same way as you would professionalised all the same esrei you to questions that we get asked onreg'lar basis and we definitely got a lot of more mind as you know these how do you feel how do you deal with people that don't take account of tote how do you deal with leadership that doesn't get the message that you are communicated rightso just so we can both understand very out of the gate here both those questions what do both as questions do what this question of his to question a something in common how do you deal with people people that don't take accountability and people that don't astenaco communicating you're nothing even how to bility the if your blaming the red hen the air blaming them for not taking account ability your blaming them from olanders and your message i ofalia your own idea entree audacious is your hundred per cent of the time so i aliter and my people aren't taking responsibility for their actions that not the refait my pole i have not insontem ow to leave prophaning shown them how to take account abilities do you do that hey you know it echo does something wrong i don't go echo you screwed this up i say echo this went wrong my fault that i heexclaimed it you well enough and like a toy baby but like hey you know what are we do wrong how do we not have we how do we make this happen you know you've got to take oldershot and that's what is that make chodo that makes chosa oh you know what no it was my fault you know what i mean and so both those questions had to i automical those problems i i take ownership of a methuen number two what do i do because to take aldershot isn't quite enough here we need we need to be smarter than that we get we need to play chest so what i always try and do from a leadership or spectives i always try and understand the perspective that other people have this kind of goes to detachment at a catch for my own head and i had a sea it from their perspective so i can understand what is it look like from echoes you point what is it looked like for my most junior guide that the not doing what i want you i isn't to it what is he seeing from his perspective what is okay my boss doesn't understand why i'm trying to communicate to him guess what what is his perspective how do i did hatch for my own head see what his perspective is because once i see his perspective i can adjust it rode so it's very important to trying understand other people's perspectives and it's usually that that hard people are often you know pretty easy to read and as soon as you leave your own head and get into tears you'll see how you can change this senario and make them understand it better so the two a big pieces yet that's the that hanother one that that applies to everything and how you were saying neither simple steps but simple but not a leviathan get out of your own head and you know a it's hard at it definitely a shoengel i he in these pressure situation esenwein were a motions are involved and i start getting fired up a people are yelling or inusitatae at rest cordoba resolves at risk it's it's definitely hard to do that and guess what those situations were tartis to do are the most critical times will you need to step back calm down step outside you nhead don't see the emotions let your ego go understand other people's perspectives that's when you need to do it the most ye oleon so wawona is your most difficult day in the military or canyon single one up and in how did it affect you shape you or or you know put you forward you don't for the time i was in the ouananiche ears and it was awesome the was i became an called a job beasts so fun and surrounded by great guy and even overseas in iraq i was having an absolute fantastic time the whole time the obviously those were the best days of my life being a combated in a compassion that's what i wanted to do my life and when i was there i knew that and those were the best days of my life and encompassed inside those great days are obviously the worst days my life and no doubt the worst days of my life were the days when my guy's got kilt and marry first you'll kill him i rack my monster or second seal killer arachnobas me see warder the metal vane for jumping on the grenade to save the three of other tea mates and riego who was severely wounded blinded in both eyes after he shot in the face who made it home and eventually after his twenty second surgery to repair the dam is that would a done to his head and face he died as well and the day that was the absolute worst was when i came home from the ployment and i didn't have those guys with me and e i was coming home to my family to my kids some my wife and they warn't and how it affected me as far as my military career goes i truly understood what was at stake in combat and when i took over training out on the west coast i was obsessed with making the training as realistic as possible in getting the guise that were going overseas to iraq and afternoon getting them as prepared as they could humanly possibly ever be to be in these worse case in aros and i remember it artamene we set up these scenarios that were very very difficult aughteen unbelievably difficult like you were going to have massive challenges and i remember i see a guy like for instance in an urban environment training i see i standing in the middle of a street you know like what you would not want to do if you were reminding thousand six and i see and i would i would give this feelingless sick to my stomach feeling because i like in the back of my mind and waiting for round to start it the ground and kill the kyrenia i will you know get fired up and declaimed to him listen you can not you got a move from cover covered only stand out nmore waters at teresina cover fire going on you know and ah that's that's how would affected me as far as my military career and how it affected me in my life now i i've already told you how it affected me those of those guys of i'm trying to hanter them by by live in the best life i can and taking advantage of the freedom that they bless me with so nicotian other question from on minard you come to know the darkness and how is it motivate you dealing with it in the using the light to win is this a star worsterer thought gasolin about the yard enacteth light i intonation it's neville a something that i something that i i evil something that i think about you know and i the world is is an evil place and there's a lot of evil in the world there's pain there's suffering there is disease that there is evil there is or i mean there's bad things in the world is and sometimes people ignotos things and and you know what a about this with with juragan quite a bit you know we we can live in a bubble here in america whether almost as no pain in their own osses no suffering and their almost as no violence in their own almost as no evil and for some reason i have always step outside that bubble and looked in seeing what the rest of world is like and so i think that a counter to what a lot of people believe the world is like and so from me that darkness is always present it's always there and at the same time there is like entheses that are incredibly generous that sacrifice greatly that give everything they have to serve other people doctors you know nurses fire fighters there's all these people teachers i mean there's just people that do all they can to help other people and in you good in the world um in so i think that just that's what i try imbalance in my mind and and i don't want people to think that i sit around and brood all day out the darkness you know because i don't you know i mean i i love that a good time and laugh and and you know smile an i want to do that you know but i also in those moments i definitely thinking that you know where lucky be her yet in unthat make like you know i don't know i day where you just kinda cruising to whatever and in you know looking for a laugh or whatever in onhanger ends or whatever doesn't don't those days seem a lot more enjoyable when you do have the darkness i in mine you know where even the man you know you have kids so let's annoyer daughter spill some milk and laughed about it right you know what thou breastfed is like death gonnoisance almost lawrenson e that key can recognize your allegret things about that little moment it's it's lot easier to recognize the great things but that little onaisy understand if you think that yes the worlds all hunky dory and milk never supposed to be spilled to the knowall this stuff in everything's perfect and in sweet and that's kind of your mind set and all the still the milk that's a disruption and earlier do but ye the fears you know i see my daughter everything ll do you still temeletes you also it's kindle that you know without hardship there can be no pleasure kind of contrast that can it brought out more no doubt about it no doubt about it um a everyone a while you'll hear people going and i just countries going like violence or whatever you alison on the getter or all this stuff and you cut if you think about it and let's see your normal day maybe not you but him probably you to your normal day ye if you let say you got up you worked out you went to the store like literate in pomegranate like temeniten you go in your sunny and mine in the gianforte you gets into a heated argument with a cash go the cashier then it starts swearing homeward omission like these prices yelling just telling adam and the isaiaher and in any ingliston this play in for fanny give them hard speeds away right yunbeai laws just that have terit in front of you you i would we would probably remember that for a while all it was was a yell men who all was no violence no laws being broken no no no physical anything does the argument between two people and some distrust as from distract you can never that that would that will do be a significant incident in your day that's all good the world is or your environment that's how good this country is a oninoor you know does we're talking about a spectrum here you don't soerine look warner but keep in my light in our environment i know here in san diego that's essentially how he is most of the time if you see two people almost get on a fight that's what significant event right there sleep so no move are would say there's a lot of light around here there loveland's i think that if you think about that i hadn't you've been exposed to it so in ten you can really have a have an actor perspective of the light is very noticeable now if you can if you can constantly have that contest i know it i know there was no doubt about that mwenni when y see he go get in the way like when is it most prevalent doing it's so prefaire aand his isa when it when i saw the question immediately thought of um dis guy whose ego just completely got in the way and he was able to fix it on this particular situation and it was mesopotamy this guy so we ah we started working with a company and the company m had a pretty young sea and he was super smart die and he had played football in college a toilanette player just a a a pretty bad as eyes super smart super articulate and when i met him i like there was little aniente him and me there was a little something thersite tension is and i'm looking to skyandren this carelton she's a bad atanasio lithuanian in the through another meeting and there's just this tension i'm going the otterskin tely e's got issues he's got problems looking this guy and i can feel a compromite he think in the time of fear you sir you figliuolo at a varieties of figure same thing i'll pay you house how i know that so as i said versely did did do like a whole like two days with his company and then we were coming back and the next time we came back i go now what's going to be like his i have this again with a shy the assertion back and sure enough there is i see him he's like looking at a looking at him and he looking in ship and all the sudden i isaiah from the situation and i longed to myself i said jocko your edites you're i was and what was i think you i was jealous of a guy yet in comitaten or jonathan's gratii was jealous i think i was jealous because you was you was a young guy that had been very successful made a toolong school and blade ball and all that stuff and i do of his stuff and what was he thinking to look at me he was looking at me thinking oh that's guy he was a island he was you jughi's a bad as and and both of us were basically envious of the other one in some way and really what it was i i guess envious wrongdoer or eagles both of our eagles had had impaction as i realized that i issidonia ly change my attitude and i was like and in the next opportunity i had you alderney or something i was like in a hat after working with you a couple of days here your awesome i said what you've done is bad asked to be your age and be dominating a company like this and if i raised a togetheriness awesome and made a tonaohgena an that's just bad asked me i have nothing but respect for you and what you've done and i actually want to learn from you all here any immediately it was like a forefooted said to me no what no matter what i've done in my life it's never going to be what you and annandale that we were brout i had to recognise the ego in the situation mine and his and i just had to disarm it and then it was all gone so the story about ego my big ugly he go and again ego you don't eat he drives people to more mekinese successful and it has a lot of positive to it but i can definitely get in the way yetmore cognize that story riblike you young realized like how that happens he all ye of yepifan when you can see the man i i can't remember the exact words how the pinafored even wear i saw it but it was your threatened tipical by something along the lines of if someone is alike capable or other be things that people have to be in your eyes for that makes them threatening to you so wooden of put real loosely when you see some one who is essentially you ye yet aretino be you like there's sam hides you retheive races you in that at siriki of equivalents that intestate assiege ye so if you get someone whose little you're annabil alike you for example some kind of built on that's one thing if he's the all round your sad the age i caneyan's because the combeite a song chinning able a dull put it out and again you're built woommera these other things that it's a lively light dogs and if yes findeisen like such eagen on someone i knew the walks in and he kind of guilt watch everyone's tahitou know ye years papa yes why in the a goes everywhere is is well the sekirei may identation hugoese other girls you yeah that that yes fayum do you do you want to go ah do you want to go over these is well you know what i have to isamisi from myself okay but any way where you can say proceed with your questions so oh conspiracy theories right an ye ethoumenon people that it bill they'll go into concertone rentals or or in nine of the inside job or a recently the uh the sand bernadino shooting like that and say you all what does say motthaven and staged it or whatever am i do you ever engage with people about conspiracy here i haven't engaged with any one about conspiracies hers so do you when you hear it like a new frexample cave herent really unfateful but i will just say on line ye can see people expressing their opinions about the conspiracy furies that they believe it tom and the really over us liter example some one expresses their feelings about a certain coetser theory to you de on what level do you entertain that not very much just a cators the board yet not very much across the board a i'm not trying to convert people and make people think things and um and i am definitely knocking you expand a bunch of energy diving into things that are not worth ivanenko with conspiracy terso can tie anything to anything if you want to i mean any major global occurrence the happening will be tied into the rest in the indocuments macaroni and cheese and men there will be a connection to craft maconachie if you dig deep enough there'll be an employee though we a purchase they'll be a plant they'll be a farm they'll be a they'll be a sales they'll be a stock there'll be some connection between that and whatever incident that happened on the globe and if you want to formulate those in titles pieces together you can do it because the world is connected and when people say oh this operation was involved in some way with this incident in this war taking place you say well yes you know there are big giant corporations that have huge interests around the world then there gonna protect those interests and that's what the world is made of so ah i don't do a lot of good bating about um conspiracy theories no to ah somebody sent me a link to like a a video about nine eleven and i clicked on it an yit was something like eight hours long at the video te vede was eight hours long at outknow and and i just thought while he you know again if you want to you can connect anything to anything if you want to that's the way the that's the way the global world is the global colomies so wait things are he he was the eidiol maii watched until i saw an eight hour ohio i know we got some questions um questions about blood murder i think that those that book which is obviously a very powerful book it's uh i think we got to say that for the next pot cast i know we got um quinosti about priscie and you know people want to know if i knew chris if i worked with chrism and the answers yes chris kilwa the lead sniper and point man in charlie paton which was lay babans he was the the osier charge of happerton and that was in tasking to bruce which i was commander of so we absolutely you know new chrysander alongside presley lays on every mission for all practical purposes that that christ was on and um you know i criticise spoke at christ's memorial service on a cowboy stadium amnesty yes we we we know christ very well and at some point well ah well i'll i'll give a finer and well well we'll talk about chrysomallo sisters about chris that would uh new provided the perspective that may not have been seen in the ah the petrais that have been given so far so i think we weed to hold off on that one and maybe to do one more question ere do you have any friend that aren't newell nihatientakona and that are not judith's i do i do mostly musicians issimust hesea serfs i i got some i got up quite a few friends that have that serenissio out here in california and ah and i got some friends that play music and you know we we rock and roll yet in that something that i actually forgot i knew hovenier but that you play guitar yes like printed or some callianassa by the wife when i was growing up and is a kid yet it it's funny like a lot of secess full people are people who are in no they always have all these skills the eden with interesting is that like surfing and playing the tale that's not easy you know it not i mean i'm not going to look in a talk that about golf but golf is seems like a atotonilco in surry some people they get good and great you know and it is it's fun and stuff but it's not like serving you know an surfing is fond and maundrell this very higher arizona more re physical challenge yes where it and the chilean a challenge that it shows when you are good at serving or not good a survey jason oh seeming and i guess this is mitibus it's always mister signalin to play it dorser ye and i thought injointure sing his two is um the nedeth like i know some guys that are um surfers and musicians and artists and i wilbraham of those guys and talked to them because they have different outlooks on things and how to get good and what kind of disappointed take and what drives them i mean you know except seringal ging curing his cold it to wed it's dark it's it's sketchy sometimes drag that you that their whole life until there seventy eighty years old it's pretty awesome you um yes well i for a am so so one more okay he at asked question will a the time you wake up in the morning and why do you wake up at that time and what do you think about where we we talked about what time awakeneth morning but i think this last question is here what do you think about before you go to bed at night and at an end really to me i mean to ticinias is out as a last question of what do you tell people or what do i think is mousieur kind of lessons learned to close on and i think what one conversation i had with a wild one of my one of my guy who is just a complete awesome warrior named j p a j p how you doing brother out there um when we were going through training to get ready for iraq and when you when you're going through filtrating you get you learn you go ousion and teach you all these stains and you lay your them on top in your brain and does layers and layers and layers of these tactics in technique and procedures and the layers can get so thick that you lose contact with the ground and so we were out in training and i was looking at j p who is a stud and it was one of those situations where where on the desert but there is rocks an there's little shrubs and all that and he was standing up in the wide open it because he was staying in the formation of the patrol of a way that he was taught in the way that he had been indoctrinated is one of those layers as year here and he stand here and this is your field to fire and you watch this area but what are you forgottens that you're standing in the middle of an open area don't stand there moved to this little rock in the move to the little shrub and then moved his little sohaweh of a bad guide look she's not going to see you and if he does see you he start shooting you have a place to hide and i said to my said j p my brother has a letsatsi i said hey ma'am if you were ten years old right now and we were out plain army out here would you stand in the middle of open trench right here would you stand here and he's like no asked where would you stand he said and governed that rock right there in her getheode as said so here ten year old brain is doing that job moving from covernor then you're twenty three year old rank and i said lessen your instincts ye know what the right thing to do as you know what it is do it and he did and it was amazing and and i think that people young me every one people listening people that communicate with us you know what the right thing to do is you know what it is you know it's be discipline you know it's work hard you know it's poloureuse you know these things he just got a do you just got to do i think we close that with that yes so am thank everybody for joined in no we had a bunch of people on a on periscope that was pretty cool a watch and we'll see how this one goes and we'll do some more in the near future yet it i like the idea that people are realigned with you on line and and phil asked a question read an you'll essentially conferick the item as actual question in a thing you er engaging i think that's a good thing because he's are o real questions it not like your sentwith up o no not to drag question she is so i would say to yesing that to me now for people with their wondering about stuff because this is in my transiting that you even said before this and and even just stuff you said to me personally a way i follow i really useful stuff and not just in business it at a pie the concept apia pretty much everything in life function life if you could function with these concepts of your give you are going to do this it'll be kind on you if you don't nothing taketoit also i i everybody for joint preciate it we'll talk to you next time out here
