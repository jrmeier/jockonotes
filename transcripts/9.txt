this is jacopo cast number nine with echo charles and me the jackal willing perhaps i stared our saviour in his sacred helpless sighed yet of called his name and blessing when in after times i died through the travail of the ages midst a pomp and toil of war have i fought and strolls and perished countless times upon this star i have sinned and i have suffered played the hero in the nave fought for belly shame or country and for each had found the grave so as through a glass and darkly the age long strife i see where i fought in many guises many names but always me so for ever in the future shall i battle as if you are dying to be born a fighter but to die again once more and that is a pole by general george as patent and i've been thinking about the pot gast that about the direction in about the things and about what we talk about and what i talk about and i was actually haven looking for a for a non military book for a book that talks about the same kind of things that i think about but is not about war because there is a very small population that are gauged in war in real war something looking for book out and i've got butchaboys that i enjoined books that i like and i've been looking for a a a good book that is not a war book and i had some close ones and maybe they'll make the cut but but but we're not there yet because because quite simply a war is that another level that's not better and is not a good thing and i don't worship war but it is in fact the ultimate human struggle yes and as judge holden in the book blood meridian puts it this is the nature of war who stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification seen so warm is the truest form of divination it is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select wars the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence or is god now montellano gonna go into blood mordington ght blood meridian of torteval on a couple o casions and one day we will and it's publike multiple shows and it's going to take research but that is a heavy heavy book that is thick with content and meaning and words at our powerful hum the natatane slice of blood mardian and we will get to it at some point and i restow people as i hate to blood murty and do bloodstone people that take a lot of information a lot of meaning from that book but i am not ready yet i'm not you know that's going to take and it's the same thing with jasper people like her when you goin to do the bar and is and the same thing i i want to be fully prepared and i'll meet it goin to eat maybe i won't be fully prepared to do the whole thing but maybe we'll take a shasheeah blood mardian shall to shakespeare and start to try and die jest them because he's a big meals if now that's why i ve you know that's why what i talking about a business but to night that's why we're not talking about a business leader that's why when not talking about a sport leader that's no we're not talking about ah a public figure that had does struggle through whatever to get to the top of the mountain that they were climbing e or come out in clime when it talking about that and we're talking about a warm and like i said war does not god like judged describes you in blood mardian but it certainly is a powerful force in it certainly is the ultimate struggle the ultimus trouble from a life against other humans that one enderlin and that it which brings us to patent and that poem you don't obviously in patents mind he he was a warrior before over over again he thought he was reincarnated at a incarnate like an what he's a soldier first these ill dreamer hundreds and thousands of years ye yes and before i do jump in a patent i do the tankers the takers of the world that the u s military we work with a one one a d the first brigade first armor the vision and remedia and two thousand six the ready first and the tacks the sixty eight ton abrams main battle tank with a giant turbine engine on finding the street apart as they come to support and rescue and save the seals which they did over and over again and i was no better sound and who were the nose takes firing up their engines and putting man gun rounds in the buildings to kill bad guys and protect american troops and we heard a lot about patent while we were working with the one one eighty because the guise the indefat tanker and even me i grew up a patten because the george sea scot movie was released when i was a kid and to this day i remember watching that for the first time and being you know all struck my parent and when you stick your hand into a bunch of go that a moment ago was your best friend's face then you ohat do that's all tinsel that was just a that's how i grew up i mean i grew up on watch the movie somebody times i came romanee you still watch it we watched it and remade we watched in remanifestation as to give mired up and if he and in it is a great movie but left talk about the real patent who actually in many ways was more colorful and more cares madoc and really larger in the life in real life then george scott in the movie could make him out to be m i read that you would when he talk and stuff he'd swear a lot he you a lot of profanity but he he did that on purpose very ended it like to to to send a message or to get his guy's fired up but in regular conversation he didn't really for a house he a mysterious guy with a lot of effective to so one kick her off so we're going to the book your just patten war as i knew it in a interestingly this book was given to me by late late babinot extremes up with me and who served with me in remotis one of my brothers so general order number eighteen is it from patent his troops soldiers of the seven army born at sea baptized in blood and crowned with victory in the course of thirty eight days of incessant battle and unceasing labor you have added a glorious chapter tone history of the war pidgins the best germans and italians could offer you've been unfailingly successful the rapidity of your dash which culminate in the capture of palermo was equaled by the dogged tenacity with which you storm came and captured messana every man in the army deserves equal credit the enduring valor of the infantry and the imp invites ferocity of the tanks were matched by the tires clamour of our destroying guns the engineers performed prodigies in the construction and maintenance of impossible roads over impassable country the services of maintenance supply before a miracle the signal cord latover ten thousand miles of wire and the medical department of vacuated in care for a sick and wounded on all occasions the navy is given generous and gallant support throughout the operation or errors kept the sky clear and tirelessly supported the operation of of the ground troops as a result of this combined effort the of killed or captured a hundred and thirteen thousand three hundred fifty enemy troops you've destroyed two hundred and sixty five of this tank two thousand three hundred and twenty four vehicles and one thousand one hundred and sixty two large guns and in addition you've collected a mass of military body running to the hundreds of tons but your victory has a significance be above and beyond its physical aspect you have destroyed the pressed he of the enemy the president of the united states the secretary of war the chief of staff general eyes now are general alexander general montgomery have all congratulated you your fame shall never die g s patent junior lieutenant general u s army a man in so you were talking about getting fired up and what you do to get forepeople fired up he very have at you i'll be asleep a very skilled writer with great command of the language can you even imagine what you'd feel like hearing that addressed to you or your people will you and your troops you and your brothers a little bit about patent few military figures in history had laid siege to the public imagination more relentless leave in georgia patent junior half a century after his exploits in north africa on sicily and a cross occupied europe his name still evoke that dash and broval cavalry charge he is widely considered the best field commander and the american army of world war two and he certainly one of one of the most feared by the germans who paid him the compliment before normandy of massing defences against a non existent army batting by the day in nineteen forty five he commanded eighteen divisions and five hundred and forty thousand soldiers a force comparable to the size of the american military at its peak in vietnam the new york times disturb declared in his obituary history is reached out and embraced general george patent his place is secure he was not a man of peace a man of peace was not but his legacy clearly transcends his military conquest he was complex and contradictory larger than life and yet all too human it is the patent paradox that transfixes this is something that we talked about before miss pocket and something that i thought about all the time and that is people strength can be their weaknesses in whom and you get a guy like pathos hyperdrive and that actually ends up being a negative in some cases even though it's stremely positive and others back to the book a warlord fighting in the name of the mocracy he was also an unrepentant aristrocratic snob so this is a guy that and they talk about the sore but a guise that was like proud of soldiers almost to a fault he revered soldiers and yet he's aristocrates devotion to common soldiers bordon reverence yet his slapping of two enlisted men nearly caused him to sit out the war in disgrace and will get into that little bit more he exuded confidence and relate relentless servitude in truth he was insecure and often confused he was well read fluentia as a wealthy as a wealthy child of privilege in the husband of an heiress at home in societies most fashionable salons he could also be crude rude and plain foolish his humility seemed heart fell yet he acknowledged an over developed personal ambition and once confessed i don't like the dirt at all except as a means to fame so i aseitas a complex gateses n a salt of the earth david hack worth guy that you never got that from him you never got that from like a guy like hackworth or that he had any sort of a quest for glory you he just to complete opposite and that's why patent he is a is not a pure figure you know not that i am would really say that i can think of any pure figures but he's definitely a very faulted ye leader and which makes it good to learn from and he had some a man men obviously i shan't here i am a a complete ideas losers at her calling ah you know general george asked at george's fontenay he faltered so don't get me don't get me wrong here yes the guy was unbelievably a powerful leader any credible leader that a credible tactician and strategist but in it is very clear that he had some of those dichotomies that when a little bit too far and one way the other if as a warrior back to the book as a warrior his fundamental prescription for waging war involved a violent attacks everywhere with everything yet he considered the carpet bambolino german cities to be barbaric useless and distric so that's that's a contradiction don't hear very much about him and here is how you seen by the higher obsolete it is an hour who wants referred to patent as this mentally unbalanced officer also told george marshall panis a problem child but he is great he s a great fighting leader in pursuit and exploitation a division commander i strive the general as invaluable in war but a disturbing element in times of peace and to that pain was flattered but perhaps the epitaph he would treasure most came from one of his soldiers before the allied invasion of france here is a man for whom you would go to helen back so clearly to his troops they held him in very high regard court from patent may god have mercy on my enemies they will need it that's that the kind of thing they that when he says people the all the front winterton here that say yes we are ready a roll uh he also said leadership is a thing that wins battles i have it but i'll be damned if i can define it in patents career recesserit trade marks a relentless aggression and faith in the offensive and in uncanny instinct for enemy intentions and disposition common seemed that we talk about all the time being on offence being aggressive and patent was an absolute probably as hines probably the most aggressive of of the people that we've talked about and of pretty much i think of all any wotever of and nicola little bit negative and we see to the creeping arrogance that hubris which would cost the american army so dearly in vietnam summing up the achievements of his troops in crushing the german counterattack of december nineteen forty four patent with panderer claims to have moved farther and faster in engage more divisions in less time than any other army in the history of the united states possibly in the history of the warrant no country can stand against such an army this smelted the disease of victory and i love that that's a that's a little something we should all remember that disease of victory victory supposed to be all positive but guess what there's something called the disease of victory back to the book the disease of victory would rout the army from within leading future commanders to under estimate their enemies and overestimate their own battle field prowess tragically the only anadot to this disease of victory would be the humiliation of defeat we see that sometimes in sports in a airesford we see it in business sometimes people need to get on both ye and when they get humbled me in urgent from the victories and then they get humbled and to get back in the game and they realize what they have to do to win back to the book as passion from military life ran so deep that he considered it as natural for me to be a soldier as to breathe war he claimed is the only place where a man really lived beyond a keen interest in technological development of armor vehicles the airplanes he retained a near fanatical belief in the importance of being meant to ly and physically ready to fight even in a war weary nineteen twenties he admonished unyoro fiers you must school yourself to savagery and speaking of savagery this is the the slaps when he slapped these young inleister the infamous slaps her round the world patens memoir gives the episode short shrift but it nearly wrecked his life in early august while visiting wounded troops on sicily the commander cuffed a soldier who had been diagnosed to suffering from battle fatigue that and called it cowardice further examination revealed the man had malaria and disentery a week later attendre ed his behaviour with another soldier and this time made motions to draw a pistol as if to shoot the wretch patent publicly apologized but remained privately unrepentant had other officers had the courage to do likewise he wrote the shameful use of battle fatigues an excuse for cowardice would have been infinitely reduced so that was a significant incident that he you know he publicly apologized but he always led in really mean that any felt he had done the right thing but still there was much cordoba on patents exploit in the battle the bodge abruptly wheeling his army around and driving one hundred miles through the icy ardens to hit the germans in the fight with seventeen divisions remains among the most storied campaigns in modern warfare and an after the war as durie was now almost an occupied state many places and as as people talked about patten being good for war but not being good for peace not turnout to be pretty accurate no longer able to attack he indeed became bolus patent was arrogant defiant and erratic as the summer of nineteen forty five tousand that's kind of the intronati now going back now to the beginning of the war and his first one of his early gurnal entries he says i have been giving every one a simplified directive of war use steam roller strategy that is make up your mind on course and direction of action and stick to it but in tactics do not steam roller attack weakness hold them by the nose and kicked them in the pants this is something that we talk about all timea's flanking people it's not keeping not going into their strengths and keep attacking a strength not you you attacking to keep them occupied but then you come round to the flank you know is in jugeait you get the neck or your tack the neck and you get the arm in combat it's frank that's what it is and he was a master of this and pushed it very very hard now we can get into a little bit more of his what do he says are his reflections and suggestions and if in his book if you if you do an updating this book ah i basically skipping the war part look the lelantine book is about what he did and how he did it and i'm skipping that and i'm said this before because i'm i liked no out what they did now they did it because that is important but like to know why they did it and what they were thinking and what principles they were following in this book beautifully breaks it down again its written by him but it breaks down what he was thinking why he did take his actions in what his strategies and tactics were and this is great because he starts off saying something that's very similar what lay and i say in the beginning of our book which is like weediness stuff whoso here is general georgias patent saying the same thing in a probably there is nothing original in one i shall now put down because war is an ancient subject and i an ancient man has studied and practiced it for over forty years so what appears to me as original thought may may be simply subconscious memories so he said i didn't necessarily think of all this then lay for night in the beginning or book say the same thing concerning the soldier the soldier is the army no army is better than its soldiers the soldiers also a citizen in fact be highest obligation and privilege of citizenship is that of bearing arms for one's country hence it is a privilege to be a soldier of good soldier to be a good soldier a man must have disciplined self respect pride in his unit and his country a high sense of duty and obligation to his comrades to his superiors and self confidence born of demonstrated ability his number one characteristic was disappointed which should come as no surprise there has been and is now a great deal of talk about discipline but few people in or out of the army no want it is or wide is necessary no sane man is unafraid in battle but discipline produces in him a form of vicarious courage which with his manhood makes for victory self respect grows directly from discipline self confidence the greatest military virtue results from the demonstrated ability derived from the acquisition of all the preceding qualities and from the from exercise in the use of weapons to self confidence comes from practice and skill and that derived from discipline disciplines clearly a subject we talk about quite a bit and and its importance in the military is cannot be overstated it really can't be and i would go so far so tell you that he disappoints importance in the life cannot be overstated in the root of all good characteristics is the discipline battles are won by fire and by movement the purpose of movement is to get a fire in a more advantageous place to play on the enemy this is from the rear or flank it had this saticulans all the time as itacoatiara with a cover a move and as laconical it in or bookcover move and this is again this is tinwork constantly working with your team and your other teams that are with you to make sure that if i'm putting down cover fire your move your moving and when you're putting down cover fire i moving you've got a work together to make that happen in every business in the world has multiple it little units in it that half to cover love talking about bravery and courage if we take the generally accepted definition of bravery as a quality which knows not cheer i have never seen a brave man all men are frightened the more intelligent they are the more frightened they are the courageous man is the man who forces himself in spite of his fear to carry on and where is that come from it comes from discipline pride self respect self confidence and the love of glory or attribute which will make a man courageous even when he is afraid there is not too many people i mean you would hackworth would never talk about the love of glory and just not not his deal not as the the when you what you mention about bravery tis how you are talking with the same harrison about it where brave reason present if you are scared of something because if you're not scared of it you're not being brave to overcome anything or to to go you know to do any kind of activity that's um you know they that you scared of so the very othoun know if i necessarily agree with that because there's guys that er you know he says he's never seen illness not not afraid i see some pretty i mean it's almost the word do you sit siraz guys that are just so brave and you look at em and then you bieliki cut up sky i had guides with me you know in my task in it and some of those gosh were so brave that i didn't think there were to make a home and it is it cause there were like um it's like a tear't scared to die at all i can don't you and and you see thee o most a lack of self preservation ready know not not stupid not not suicidal but like all this got hasn't think he can be killed you we were talking about that on last pot cast i forget the name of the major that was on the beach landing it too winkin he's up and his acheloian have me come on yeh i i've seen guys do that ye so is part actual bravery goes though the wood you consider that um like let's say kate to guys are going to go go do some lie in my maight rain and one guess really scared above competing in front of people it is first sight as on like that then you have this other guy who whose not who dispels different same exact situation but he looked fired up these knots scared at all and they both go into a duet did they both exercise the same bravery you dunno you know and our novamater oh yes for one thing i can tell you the guy that's acting like he's not scared to probably the one that's more scared yes with ever may find fresh and it's an eye she's too that combat to guide that her overly like bravado or nominor scared and an again there is nothing wrong with that or not old against them but um he have seen guys sitting in brief to an an operations dad you can tell or or or petrified he usually it's a guy that not you to it may be may be someone that's visiting in an airy of operations and shows up and so we're going to take you on or on operation and you get to see them they are they're scared the there not used to it all the guys from my task in it you know they might be scared but their confident they know what they're doing there they've they've put that fear side over over again so it's not that big of a deal but you see a guide deal with that fear for the first time the in is specially stands out because you got a bunch of confident guys that that now that understand that understand the risks so you can see their faces then you see like that guide that i come in from another area and is going to go out an operation and and there their capenates during the brief and their looking round ye and they got overcome that fear and if they stay there for a few weeks though they'll get used to it too yes o good kind of be looked at as um just just the act itself whatever act if it's understood and being yet sam harris's point was that it does matter if there's a machine gun nest and your horrified to go charge it and i'm not and we both gocart it it you just had to pretend that that you weren't scared it doesn't matter you were still be a brave read it and and i did have to pretend but i'll be embraced so it doesn't matter what ever pretending or not you are brave if you go free and it may be his to overcome or do something that's understood generally as being scarey to is not that her tea if turkey still being delarive you are but yet i say and i guess in a real black and white turmoil if you're not scared of this activity you're doing and you do it and you logerait then you're not being braveness in generally sporting like featureless sky divers yes god ovis with five thousand jobs tharon ritornare you more yet but i know you when i'd done like you don't fifty jumps you're not really scared any more red you're just doing it and gustavus and jumping of carnall that to they do right so they're not being brave there just doing their job there is doing their thing yes the ledesma jumping up for the first time and he scared and overcome but for an umsteigen ye right so the aetas kind of point yes if i go outside and check the mail on that being brave or you're not over but what if there is like a tiger or something out there they in a really matatiele it's pretty very right tigers going off to tirshatha section here small unit tactics and you a question whether i want to put this in there but i know that i'm getting a lot of feet back from guys that are in the military guys that are in squat and this is something that i used to talk about and i know it's true squad should seldom be split so want to keep your force together as much as possible however if it is necessary to split a squad be sure that the unit separated as at least capable of mutual support is something as to hammer the seals about it i got too far away from the other unit where you can't support him any more that's problematic now that now that other units alone and that means if each unit that separate should have the ability to support immenstadt have some finer power in some strength this means that the unit separated from the quaedam not fewer than three men the squad possesses in itself weapons necessary for a base in fire and manoeuvring element this should be in dissoutes be its invariable method of attack but the squad leader should not spend so much time thinking which way he is going to envelop that he suffers casualties which would have been avoided had he attacked at once so don't hesitate don't sit around when and to get it on get it on tatnall about the taking action another small unit tactic visitor one always capture the highest terrenate in our vicinity at once and stay on it and that is something that we executed all the time in ermiline high ground gitanos buildings fine three story building amongst the two story buildings find a two story building amongst the one story belding always open for that high ground in the in the rural areas any kind of noble and he kind of bump anything they give you the yground is what you're looking for and as i sat last time from an epical in from a moral standpoint i groped take to high ground with a high round take lee got to watch out for that don't delay the best is the enemy of the good and these are common that is the common saying now the best is the enemy of the good by this i mean that a good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week war is a very simple thing as a determining turatist are self confidence speed and audacity none of these things can ever be perfect but they can be good he talking about now general officers being the senior leaders and these applied to everything nonius senor leaders there more tired division commanders than there are tired divisions tired officers are always pessinus remember this one evaluating reports generals must never show doubt discouragement or fatigue general should always adhere to one type of dress so that soldiers will recognize them they must always be very neat and most importantly for my perspective i like what he says here in cold weather general officers must be careful not to appear to dress more warmly than the men you don't want to do that you don't want to be in the comfort so when the boys are suffering you will let your debating not on i'm not imitating you of it i have a ishutin at question said the question so let's say your boss or you of this office and this often like decked out meanwhile everyone on your team i have no offices is that an example of what he's no onegine rally because you actually do have more work to do you have you have to have meetings in your office and and an interesting to because i i i didn't i light it and in this for the series but there were saying that general patent wasn't a force arenal he was at twenty eight starers we heed poiseful uniform on he had four stars on his collar on each collar for star and he shoulder for stars in the helmet and four stars on each one of the handles of his pit of his pearl handled pistol grip forty five so the guy was on like a little bit of a man that's a that's a show man that's a that's a that's a deva right so he didn't you know he he knew that there is a certain amount of showmanship ye being in leadership as is not that sort of what alabout by beat recognizable men very recognized will ye had stars all over his cars and everything yes that's more like it the comfort of a battle so you peticuly could as a sea you could absolutely take that to the wrong level where your you know just live in and total luxury in all your people out and you know cramp into cubicles that you know your your folks are ently look at you in a negative way yes but you but to have what's needed for the job you know of when i was to you commander had an office that was mine in a eneid space in their to work em but i wasn't you know shipping in stakes for me to have every night while the men were eating i am all read ye so discometer keep yourself in check little bit lone travel you go first class meanwhile you send your team and coach that's a point to gain sometimes the the boss is traveling for a glance because when he land he's got a present and he's got a eye got to be a little bit better rested sometimes the boss man is just sick of being cramped in a little tiny seat i will yet you do got you got to keep that in check and i'll tell you when i was when i when i worked for the admiral of all the seals it in five for a class we were in the cheap seats and they are very careful about that they don't want to think that they owe the the military elias flying around first class now were in the cheap seats sitting in the back of delton you can be up yet yet there's so many just the field reasons in business like any identity with go along with that too but you just got to use your judgment you in got a use your judgment and made sure that you know every one is aware and you know a ten year old field jacket when it gets cold in your wernerian new down and ortega manour people are gonnot respect you yes you you can't just deck yourself out when the boys owertrue ers are suffering yeh yeh an in the hoematis where or how you mentioned what he talking about where it can be categorized as being recognizable interacts a lot of things even stuff outside of just uniform that a see how he presents himself daidalee him recognizable the alfarache a reasons but i'm sure i'm sure most the time no one's perfect where there gondest doing it disinfected have to be enters good there kid business leaders now that did follow this type of lead him in look at coliseo business ah i get in decked out as a picture of a egidius face botigas all pictures caused the other days got wet bunch of gray teachers and their range and i am from what i hear i am like ben to opposite nothing he his head esn't have an office he had leave visits open space i ones coding and lonely that in his discussing in in there that well you so ye there's yankees all kinds of disappointment there you i guess to depend on the business it's herhor this part is on debatable but general officer i will invarious the responsibility for failure whether he deserves you re not and invariably gives credit for success to others whether they deserve or not will achieve outstanding success so it was something that we call extreme hosanna barbro it some one taking ownership is georgia's patent joy for jack in your ideas georgia and i integrate all that was like such a prominent idea that then the echo like rowing up and in an out never heard about that i i don't and and when lay one presented his book to people fatal say oh this is a very common theme that i've heard my home i know they go this is out standing and were saying as act sane thing the gentle george's contenait air which is uh obviously extremely important me issuing orders the best way to issue orders as by word of mouth from one general to the next failing less telephone conversations which should be recorded at each end however in order to have co a confident tory memorandum of all or are given a short red order she always be made out not necessarily at the time of issuing the order but it should reach the junior prior to carrying out the order so that if he is forgotten anything he will be reminded of it and further in order that he may be aware that his senior has taken definite responsibility for the operation ordered orly is as something that i used to do this all the time if i had have conversation with my bag i still do to this day if i have a conversation with some one and we talk about something i'm falling at the little mail and because also or all conversations people here what they want to hear and they might hear to it from things you know if i tell you he will then report record this poast hey cecisbo as on saturday you like all yea definitely is that mean we are de that men in your mind you think we are but radium back you know so i just follow stuff up nice to tensely servia we i give to order i'd get it at a conversation with someone he was either love me or below me a whatever i'd followed up the email of what i thought the conversation meant and the hay just confirm what we talked about here's the three bold points i'm going to do this you're going to do that were going to do this and boom it's done and we have a documental and it exists and that we were confirmed yet and so the high you bring up that example where if you think he can we record pipestem saturday ten mile you just that's a yes or a no question i yes we can't like the hero we have that ability that's announced anything on mekin you so so i could have taken it either way only like you we can and i shall pertain you're all yea i didn't know were out in the road you just said now am when i first started getting up more more iranians the it was immediately noticeable that that was a common thing they'd always fought out with with an email right after and he ouch man it does you got to do it it is my all this i love this it is my opinion that army order should not exceed a page and a half of typewritten tax and it was my practice not to issue orders longer than this usually it can be done on a one page and the back of the pages used for a sketch map and wonty favorite part about this is if you get some one that can't give you the orders in like a page you then that means there orderest eusebia need to simple father plan an he's good say this a few times commanders must remember that the issue and of an order or the devising of a plan is only about five per cent of the responsibility of command the other ninety five per cent is to insure by personal observation or through interposing of staff officers that the orders carried out were as must be issued early enough to permit time to disseminate them thirsting like it only five per cent your job become up for the plan and disseminate the plan the other ninety five per cent your job is to make sure it happens in taken old or ship of the plan and get it implements is the most important part of this section never tell people how to do things tell them what and they tell what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity so you want to give them sort of the broad ay is it what i want you get down and let them figure out how to do it you're not going to be able to tell everybody on your team at what the de ive do at all that you've got to let them run ye got a use the little decentralized command as we like to say yet in the creative world that's a really really significant thing to do sanehat and then let that person do it cause if you have some creative vein left do little critico joe how do i do with that cause your disordered creative and ear he now am i get good erwald i say no what echo hears what i say no and then i disbacca and you run with your game ye and that's the yeaton's not don't make many a fatal the creative you will on enough tim sure it's equally as applicable everywhere here i realize that i can't when he was you got an expert you know what i am thing well it was intemese thing enough and it isness world you if you're the diffiding bowman you shouldn't you you're not cannow how to do all the technical things at the folks in the foliere not going to have the creativity because you have the capability because you've got other things you should be worried about it so get on those other things unless your people run i let him run in this ah i disadmire that when any one has fairly mastered the art of command than necessity for that art usually expires either through the termination of the war or through the advanced age of the commander and this is just a this is is a damascene than it away it is an it's as it this way in the military or the well you start feeling like you willy gotten good at that job you're on your next job um and ah that doesn't feel good so it's a bummer um and there was a little example on i talked about him being aldergrass ive and this is from a section this is from a section which i didn't take i don't think i took much out of it all this one's called the sexton calderini pay as but these important decisions that he made but the very they take their little bit complex some of them but this one was fairly concise about the fifth of september it became apparent that we would brought out a gasolene stockant for his tanks we would run out a gasolene i directed the two cars piconine the advance until the tanks ran out a gas and the de go on on foot this was actually done and the bridge head across the azelie was secured as a result there was considerable resistance on the part of coromantee what appeared to them an unnecessarily danger operation its success again proved that it was not dangerous so at that's pretty aggressive ay you drive until the tank running as in the case granadas get out of the takes and walk i let a tree legist lissa like a in this old team an we're goin to take the boats with the boat run out of of gas will tell the boats of the tenor n out a gas will get out and swim we'll keep going until we get it done letter of instruction number two so these are what these are what this guy and i loved this is what this die was riding as instructions to be handed out the old as men i mean annis's document so you wonder what patent thinks about you ast wonder it's right here so here is his is letter instruction number two discipline there is only one sort of discipline perfect discipline man cannot have good battle the suppliant poured ministrative discipline discipline is based on pride in the profession of arms on meticulous attention to detail and on mutual respect and confidence discipline must be a habit so ingrained that it stronger than the excitement of battle or the fear of death and this is why it every day and every decision that you make in keeping that desplein i actually have been hearin you know ye hear that this this that you will power deteriorates and i accoont believe that i think the more they say oh you know i eat to out the day you will power taste to me times it gets weaker and weaker actually that actually believe it gets stronger mind gets stronger than when i'm you the more i hold the line the stronger the whole is the matter the griffin on indolent by day they might anormal like it's all together it's all concaten you wake up early an you git your work out in it you just stay in a track you in on what i'm not going to eat that food that i will need right now not me you know it's so much easier but the day would like i didn't want i awoke up lad and so i think it my work out down or you know what there's the telga rent he owed it he breaks out yes he wanted you want to use the discipline disappointed forces disciplined yes yes i formare disappoint makes more disappoint ye canna seems like that it would be just like any other exercise write your answer sizing you discipline silan may i don't know but maybe this is what that means when they say it your will power were down let's say ye tranto stick to this diet right man you're going to be like him not going olet myself get too hungry cause when i let myself get too hungry i know that do not seem way more viable tonanti but one fit you know for you to pay it hayrides it um you know it's like basically so if i test my wolf i am to sing throat the span of a day or two you know hard many hours when you start to get hungry so if in ill case so let's say you take your hunger to a certain point then you say you want a on its stick the stick stay strong usually i i eat way before this that i'm in a real hunger i really want those donuts but you lent him the stick with it right and you have that one that one extensor taking your hunger to a certain point and still sticking to it you do that you let your hunger gun for even more that's your will parwar down wearing down but but say you stuck to it boom and you stuck to his that day than the next day you have experienced going that far in utter hunger and you will be stronger and no how to deal with it i actually in discredit you i think that when you stay strong you get stronger and when you break like i often soaped all to have one by the that don't for me atingle time and then you have that one by the hot happened yet that onontio one play ten it single that some saying stay strong hold you to a unemployed yes so to compete compare that till like a work out right so let say i i do hard um set of an napishu then i do another heart set a push up among a be less strong on that second sad and i do another set you i keep that he has your boy the next day or the next week i'm going to have benefits from that work up your foot does reinforce um i so the work out the fatigue is that temper of fifteen you re come from an end in your stronger the way through the nicanor better example is like when you say no to the one by your it easier to say no to the whole do not yes when you say yes to the one by its easier to say i know that so to say no i don't give you discipline and tact a man disappoint back to the book discipline can only be obtained when officers are so imbued with the sense of their awful obligation to their men into their country that they cannot tolerate negligence officers who failed to correct errors or to praise excellent are valueless and peace and dangerous misfits and war so he's giving equal equal importance to correcting errors and praising excellences how important it is not something that i've never been very good at i was never beg praiser of excellence and and in reading this i look back and say i should have done that more officers must assert themselves by example and by voice they must be pre eminent in courage deportment and dress one of the primary purposes of discipline is to produce alertness a man who is so lethargic that he fails to salute will fail will fall an easy victim to the enemy so the discipline just keep you on track combat experience is proving that ceremonies such as formal guard mounts for more reeform ations in regular and supervise revolfer ations are a great help and in some cases essential to prepare men and officers for battle to give them that perfect discipline that smart tis of appearance that alertness without which battles cannot be won and this is something i the seal teams first sure are very undisciplined when it comes to uniforms when it comes to maromme don't march i mean we we barely can get in whenever whenever a bunch of seals have to do something militaristic is usually a prey we have to omit down and make it as easy as possible a because we just don't do it enough minona's what i'm just i'm kind o stating that because we spend all our time to whene'er a practicing for war were not doing anything ceremonial we rochester war so this is kind of a funny little dichotomy there is that seals generally are not ready for a military inspection under ready for combat so there's a little little hippicus ill epichorial idea about that combatants number one there is no approved solution to any tactical situation little feemarraine come back again ye here is no affusion you've got to figure it out there is only one tacklin which is not subject to change it is to use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wounds death and destruction on the inman the enemy in the minimum amount of time that's a bresil and straightforward principle and according to general patent it does not change battles are won by frightening the enemy fear is induced by inflicting death and wounds on him detenus are produced by fire fire from the rear is more dead being three times more effective than that from the front but to get fire behind the enemy you must hold him by frontal fire and moved rapidly around his flank front attacks against prepared positions should be avoided if possible i told you he's going to talk about flanks he sakerdan catch the enemy with by the nose with fire a kickin in the pants with fire and placed through nothin that's flings you can never get too strong yet every man and gun you can secure provided is not unduly delay your attack i used to say we we'd try figure out how de guys would bring on a mission and i'd get some kind of you know restriction like he wellingting this many guys might say well this is the softer for well my allowed to bring a leven persition i now bring thirty eight if i can bring furthest while when i stop myself with tony a seven you don't brings me people you can be to go was ranker the larger force and the more violence you use in the attack whether it be men tanks or ammunition the smaller will be your proportional losses violence of action is what we used to call that in the celtis violence of action never yield ground it is cheaper to hold what you have than to re take what you have lost never permitted unit to dig in until the final objective is reached then dig wire and mine so you can't rest until you get to good spies i whose little statement are you on juditious cantel the they get in position and the rest before its time crespino got o eve got to get the guard back you've got it if someone is some one pass your guard that you don't you'll settle there on your back and let them settle in and certain to smash you as soon as some one passed your guard your a covering you work you don't you don't settle down on to your back to a good position i could never do that i noticed that and actually brought it up to member less just less linkwater one we roll and i was like this something that i noticed about you that um and that was that in the scramble you won't just settle and hang out in my guard you don't even accept the garden or both long time ago do for but it referate he's in just really prevalent that day that yet in the scramble you know cambales on fire let's say a longer time the thoughts crumbles on for six seconds and look pretty long scrapit seems like you still wouldn't ave you an even stopped the scumble until you're beyond the guard in a it yet you want to hang out when me as i thought it right in that guardian rest at sea but um an it's surprisingly painfully effective ye we outoi was talking to debout that yesterday if dan is in a mind set where he is excepting a guard pass or he's accepting it it becomes a much much much easier game i need decide he's not one to let you settle until he gets his the advent advantage position and it's a night yeah because he won't stop moving and he's a good scamper ye yes you know what's interesting about these i have a note nearer that you don't you sit never yield ground never permitted units dig in he says never and that's something it i ansari bein he takes away the fact that of what he said earlier about there's no written rules are no a proved method ran ye shouldn't use that word never be it sometimes you should yield ground re and sometimes you should dig an even when the final objective so i know you just be an extreme but it is i i did make a note of that to point out general training back to the book more emphasis will be placed on the hardening of men and officers all soldiers and officers should be able to run a mile with combat packin ten minutes and march eight miles in two hours the hardening of men officers tegean the say sharpen axes pickaxes and shovels now and keep them sharp that's just an attitude right look the pick axe you used to dig in make it sharp case you got a hack somebody brain out keep it sir ye battles are fought by platoons and squads place emphasis on small unit combats structions that is conducted in the same precision is close to ardri a good solution applied with vigour now is better than a perfect solution ten minutes later common seem needless requirements he's actually got a section in her called needless requirements there is a tendency and i used to see this in a military and i see a business is now this is the needless requirements there is a tendency for the chain of command to overload junior officers by excess of requirements in a way of training and reports you will leave me at this burden by eliminating nonessentials demands you to any business and they've got rupert that people are generating and meetings that there attending and conference calls that's what this is about those are needless requirements give rid of them amatepec ally those meetings like it i think people just like meetings cause it it um it helps them think or feel like your doing it doing something you want do you make me these twenty minutes of but it just homophone year ozolopan yes yes but meetings are making make your being twenty minutes on it you have to schedule he show up on the meeting ready to don't you don't need to learn anything was no or go to talk about get out about the decision because that's what everyone needs to get on the phone for it's for the decision yea you should he can get informed by reading a quick bulleted less segovia's with me when i iraida leanest on or something like that like i i i got a case in the sayacusca pose he as in an in the meeting a lot of the time let's say the man of ten guys and looks say three four guys are are disgusting stuff and may be their transalpina they suicidally have in them the other few guys they feel compelled to want to be contributing to the meeting so they say is more the stuff that's so unnecessary just so they can have something to say in the meeting sabotagin somewhere else you angered echo people you directorate meeting yes keepen through as a whole there is a whole lot of people in america in business world that are listening to that needless apartments and their thinking about the needless opimius fairhill on a daily basis and it makes me angry it is afraid to it a source of prostration i thought to folks about it all the time light they feel like they don't have time to do the job and we felt like than the military and the legare you serious we have to do you know phil out this document a tender never call with the so and so commander or just tell me you don't give me the high lights and let me do my work i got a job to do here a people infantry infantry must move in order to close with the impetuous move in order to close with the enemy i must shoot in order to move again there's covered move when physical targitaos able the fire of all infantry what weapons must search the area occupied by the enemy he is marching fire it reduces the accuracy of his fire and increases our confidence shoot short ricochets make nasty or sounds and wounds that something that they salado all the time and sits so you don't you make sure your shooting low if you're going to make a mistake aim low so the to the rounds hit in front of where the enemy is and they repose up and they had him with our kind of frag and rocks and falashas still hiding if you shoot over their head and miss i mean god to intrusting to halt under fire as folly to halt under fire and not fire back and suicide and this word dark longitudinal under fire as he did us dear do it ye when you wouldn't when you let me keep scrambling when you stop rambling and that's what i'm going to get a lointaine and guess what it says here that that is too asimov forward out of fire officers musset the example few men are killed by the bayonet many are scared by it bayoneted be fixed when the fire fight starts bayonets must be sharpened by the individual soldier the german hates the man net and is inferior to our men with it our men should know this little psychological warfare here you got to sharpen your own band at your better at it than the enemy put that thing on the end of your gun when the fire fight starts get ready to get some yeh that's that's general patrigh there keeping it real i wonder work for general patted caro men officers are responsible not only for the conduct of their men in battle but also for their health and contentment when not fighting an officer and his worries go back to the sea and how they act and all to must be the last man to take shelter from fire and the first to move forward similarly he must be the last man to look after his own comfort at the close of a march he must see that his men are cared for the officer must consist constantly interit interest himself in the rations of the men he should know his men so well that any sign of sickness or nervous strain will be apparent to him had he contakes such action as may be necessary same thing we were commerdate about you a wrapped this up here with a cup more and i kind o saved the best for last to be quite honest with you such as this right here command leadership and this is a thesis actually another letter of instruction again this is just what you want to know what how general patent thought here it is his own words on what he wanted his men can know as they prepared for combat leadership full duty each in his appropriate fear will lead in person any commander who fails to obtain his objective and who is not dead or severely wounded has not done as foldeth doesn't need to be much clearer than that near there is there's your there's your standard if you're not dead or severely wounded and you haven't achieved your captive objective you haven't done your full duty visits to the front the commanding general as chief of staff should visit the front daily the function of these is to serve not to meddle in addition to their own specialty they must observe and report anything of military importance remember that praise is more valuable than blame so rigging the from introosion cle thembla him raises em remember too that your primary mission is a leader is to see with your own eyes and be seen by your troops while engaged in personal reconnaissance execution in carrying out a mission the propagation of the order represents not over ten per cent of your responsibility the remaining ninety per cent consists in the sharing by means of personal supervision on the ground by yourself and your staff proper and vigorous execution and that's when we already talked about ye you put together the plan yeah you disseminated the plan that's great your job is to make it happen and i sure that it happens i take ownership of it and execute plans plans must be simple and flexible actually they are only a form of bad a plan from which you build as necessity direct or opportunity offers so he say in that plan is jist a disonerable off of as as necessity direct your opportunity offers but asked to see other day at a adaden you don't when do you know what time to change the plant when i i you know when necessity directs or opportunity offers that's when you make the change plans should be made by the people who were going to execute them for more orders for more orders will be preceded by letters of instruction and by personal conferences in this way the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear together with the mission to be accomplished by each major unit to resand the the the whole purpose of the operation will be made clear so that if during combat during combat communication breaks down each commander can and must so act as to obtain the general objective they go so if you understand what the old roll broad mission is when we go out to attack in all the sudden year separated from us or you don't can communicate with us any more or so something happens and you o makin adjustor plan as long as you know what the broad mission is the whole purpose of the operation which later and in aping called the commanders in ten that we called it a net in the modern military iolas una what the commanders intent is what the intent of the operation has been you can execute on your own etonian more direction for me you go and make it happen keep your own orders short get them out in time issue them personally by voice when you can keep troops in formed use every means before and after combat to tell the troops what they are doing going what they are going to do and what they have done reiterating discipline there is only one kind of discipline perfect disappoint if you do not enforce and maintain discipline you are potential murderers you must set the example and dition high physical condition is a vital to victory we talked about that and we talk about that all the time your physical conditioning high physical inditin is vital to victory there are more tired corn and division commanders than there are tired corn of visions fatigue makes cowards of us all men in condition do not tire so you got to be in shape and here is the close in the so the last one and it's the shortest one an it's probably the most important one to remember from general patent courage do not take counsel of your fears that's it that's what he had to say about currents to all his troops as they embarked on this intense combat day after day week after week you anne what you do with your fear do not take counsel of your fears no bill they don't get a vote or fears don't get a vote so next time you feel that fear no matter what it is it's pretty easy eye don't take counsel of it they get no vote that's general patent great book greatly iter lots to learn lots the pass on war as i knew it questions from the interests me first question joaille is djigelly practical for street defence where there are no rules my unstanding is that it doesn't farewell against knives and multiplices comparative something like crammag wattie boxing so it is a good question obviously and its questionee get a lot i got a lot uh i actually did a video we did of idea like this and then paris parted out so you can look for that if you got an o hear her another version of this maybe we could link to it on cacadores i think we can do that ye excellent um what okay so self defence or was onoocool the fancier first and foremost most important thing and actually didn't say this on the last video but i should say it now he is situation will weariness he taunting yourself even good situations were bad things are not i do happen to you and doing that to the best you bilitin you being aware of your surroundings that of the very important first step in self offence second guns ah if you are a person that really needs to defend yourself and you live in a four blare and there silent people around and you might be as small a very small person here you might be elderly or you might absom sort of a physical limitation then how you're going to defend yourself is do you think on using agun so i mean that that's just that just a waitin now okay so that ben said ah maybe you can't have a gun baby don't have a gun and you don't always want to have to pull a gun out even though a gun is a great deterrent and most people of face that you vagon are knocked on what to fight you any more but i'll recey can't be just yankee a gun out of anything that happens and you don't always have him with you for instance you know in certain places are not allowed to have a gun certain state you're not allowed to have a gun in a in the water your surfing and i lowthian ah so what do you do how did you toussac against these other marshall arts i say that you should learn you just you first should be the first martial art that you try and learn to defend yourself and there's a reason for that there's a bunch of reasons for that number one in sort of a base weeson but you do those probably the most complex de lord there's the the is the isthmus three dimensional martial art it not linear it's very three to menialities it infinite in what you learn so you want to get into it early because gonna take longer to learn if that's that's actually a secondary reason for the primary reason to learn you to do first is because of the nature of self defence situations so we are born with our primary form of self defence and we learn it from the very young age and our primary form of self defence will keep you safe from most of these situations and that is running and using your legs to run so an if ye think of not think about this your kind of chuckling because you don't understand the gravity of what i'm saying cause it's very accurate alistenin talking about the self defense where it talamatan to talking by defensorius safe in so if i square off with you and i want to fight punch you run away i'm not holding on to you i run away if there's me and three of my friends run away a fi have a knife and in the contain stab you run away so all bees kind of attack there are a disconnected attack i'm not holding on to you so run away from me get out of there run into a public place run to where there's other people that can help you run where this changes his when somebody grabs a whole of you when somebody grabs a hold of you you can no longer run away and you have to be able to make them ungraduated go of you there and how do you do that you do that by knowing how the grapple and grappling as you jitsu that is why the first thing you should learn is you got to because if some one's not grabbing a hold of you run away from them if someone's trying to square off and and go to a tell with you run away from them if there's five guys that want to fight you run away from them they someone pulls out a knife on you run but here's the deal if that person knox you down to get on top of you you can't run any more so would have to do yeatara them and you have to know your gito to to get them up and offer you and get away from them or submit them and put them to sleep or break the arm that is why you should start with you gito pretty straightforward agreed once you know judith absolutely learn mo time learn wrestling learn boxing learn cronaca lorna scream in a learn everything you can about fighting do it of course but set your base with the one that you're gonna need is somebody grabbed you and that's tugither other thing about you deters it's pretty easy to add in some of these other more animalistic self defense situations whom so if somebody grabbed you and pose you to a ground and you want to get away from the yacht you can you need to know your body positions but it's pretty easy to decide you're goin to bite their ear off or big take a big chunk out of their face with your teeth jim your fingers in other eyes that it's it's not hard to augment that stuff you so these are all things if you can do within jugulat yogees not a hamper that ability to be savage in your attacks on people yet that in outshine sting you bring up because every herd begun where he'll be like hey what's that you through whatever and then i don't know you she or you explain it and they'll be like old wolf all just all i just got your eyes out right here or i this um you know on noustre your thrill or something like this right so take the eye gouging on obtient you don't have to be trained to a gouge we both or i got you sallie if you if we're going to go i gouging yes i've had people try to double before yes no insanities in stamped out the secunt an soetur brother ruth off your like metamoras were talking and he the deep basically did that he was asking questions to you be like you not yet i won't want i don't have to learn you get to old just do this and he like so i know like pressure points and that subdued people and i was the after so i said okaredo yes exactly so like okay well what the pressure point though so as like to the pressure point on me i won't even like fright you back and he did the one like her by the animal and i was like not only to that not hurt right now i've been acansea the hurt more than if you did it here but not only does that not really hurt that much right now if if we were in any kind of fight situation i don't even think i would even notice that though so uspallata who will give me a dissonant did when i behind my ear in the war i read see exact thing it yet it's more sensitive for sure but is a oreseian i in yet it simply does not work but the egidio know joie you can still do all those things if you want to do it but you don't even have to secure your poem sweet yea and i would say even i might pinion more accurately gitup you or it'll give you the ability to control the fight or for sure so you can lie ognuno going to learn how to throw like a sack left hook or nothing like that you're not to win that um but you'll control the fight where if you want a punch someone you'll be in the perfect position to punch on the matter how much punching training you have you can have no punching training thank you saddeneth ugh your fist on em in whatever capacity way marechel you know juice and a goetherian other one of these moves that people say they'll do if so you do dodson that girl you're the one going to control the fight i tried all all those people coming to me and i've gone through them all set no factor the pressure points the this the that doesn't work sorry sorry to tell you it might work like you at the risk on it yes sit there read let them do him belike okay yea that her and also going on some of the completely untrained you can help some sort of success with some of this stuff red but adding instanter end to tack her yet and that dandelion the point where it's a ya i say yet it might work if you let him do it but that's the thing you don't let them do it in reality learned golightly hood of that work it in very very low just about her to share in edgewood hit's creative yes it's a good work out in over confidence he gets used to come combat of situations where you're going on and present fee you get you used to have in some one grind on you and try and smash in him has a big deal that i did leaving the incubator just having some one in in girls especially it were just people won't use to confront in man when you get in a fight at a knockulist you to the career of having somebody in a allurion you and try to smash you in i want to say it was youse four m which one was one hardimont one glass was at the one as one who had so he mounted and tapped here and man that's a perfect example he didn't get punched you know he didn't that from an nupon shor submission and he that mounted and then in an interview later i saw he said man i was just feeling costafuentes there and if you watch it and he wasn't monteforte artois just fanny this lesius to that and immense real life fight some one attack you in there like a moon you and you don't know duncan have pen you outmillion digitated is no factor presson people they know mantecado good where they hope they gave bouteille can get on top you know and then say compare those two sides of the spectrum together joined all next exquisita you expand on the how to appropriately effectively intacte lead up the chain of command in a profession that's considered to be very peramelidae my line of work i sometimes work against us limming limiting ideas and ways of doing things the other agamuntic dition in their line of work is a akasita organization of your working in and you've how do you lead up the chanaan well he even in a paramilitary organization which you infer that this is a very high arcestrates and its chain of command driven and how do you possibly get your boss to do what you want them to do well he actually fairly simple philiipe not easy but simple it is it is hard to do it does take a lot more to touste a lot of tack fixed on a patient so number one you got to build trust you've got a bill trust with your the people that are above you in the chain i command you got a builder relationship you got to be practice you've got to stay ahead you know when i joined the military i want you when they stole my dad hay by the way i joined that i listened in the navy mobilian and three weeks or whatever my dad just looked at me in shook his head and he says you're going to hate the military because you hate authority you don't listen to anybody and i was kind of young stupid kid and a whenever i'm going to the seal teams is tembe don't have to listen anybody of course i was completely wrong in you do listen to people and you do have a chain of command but he was right in the fact that i didn't like to listen to people and i didn't like a forty so how do they get ahead of that he was pretty easy what i did to get ahead of that was i got ahead of it and that's what you need to do here you have to start that the start that attitude of where you're doing what needs to be done before you get told to do it and so you start to appear to have more knowledge and good for sight of what's going to happen now you gotta be careful that you are not showing up the boss ye can't be fought in their face and already did that you know because i'm so much better than you at not a go here the goal is to build confidence not to build animosity you don't want to go to animosity one to build trust you want to build confidence you want to make that person start to realise all good you are mum again be careful not to throw to their face now the tradition can and and sometimes people do cling on to the traditions and they used the traditions to shut down evolution and that bad because what there really doing is their protecting there while the protecting their existence answer that a that a big wall that a big hard wall to get through now most people do have traditions and traditions what orisons built up and we build traditions or our traditions of failure and were probabat and are the traditions of losing or that one the traditions are proud jenisons traditions of winning the traditions of excellence and in some way tuitions of exonerations of winning and traditions of domination half to be tied in some way to evolving and to adapt thing and do getting better because that's how we win that's how we dominate so you have to find out all in the tradition that part of the tradition that implies that what we do it orchardson is we get better now that's all it is you just got to find that thing that says we get better we win and you take that you carry that that lead that little crack in the armour of tradition and and you turn that into you know yet we have a projection swimmest and if you're going to be the best as the best stagnate now the best of valves and again you gotta be careful you can't fool this in their faces you you got to say anyhow orchards at were the best we make things happen and we get things done that we always do it better than if i went else see you know what he's one way we get to a bar ye did this you got a look felose as in the tradition to bring forward changed now again the most important ness saying that is you got to continue thigh that relationship with your spirits you constantly trying to build that i said this before all say again no matter who i ever worked for i had the same relationship with the crazy boss with a knuckle had boss with a loser with the great god had the same relationship all time that was they trusted me i didn't matter to a work for so you got a bill that relationship of trust you've also got to be careful that as you're trying to be proactively trying to get things done at that you're not looking to do it for your own ego to get credit because that disturbs the people at the top they makes him say all these destroying to shine to try to look good screw him throw his ideas out that's what you got to watch out for so that's your ego don't make your ego fight there ego cause they've gotten ego to you want to let your ego go bill that relationship make the change slow it's going to be slow steady and it's connotated persistence in the long war do you got to have patience tradition doesn't break down over night tradition takes time to more to get to be ready for that long war and don't get frustrated you are part of a winning team your party would teetatota ition it just kinda add to that tradition and that's going to take time it that's how you do next question i i how about on a podcast de talk about what is the essential equipment for a home jim a okay so for me first of all if you have nothing your building from zero but first thing he is pelops a politer and a departure where do you get since i'm more to do papa at that's what you need now be careful if you're listening in your like okay i'm goin to buy a pulpiteer don't get the little flimsy looking things that cost one and twenty nine dollars you don't want that he's a hole to work for is better than nothing but is almost worthless you want to get a legit dip far legitur or dip ours are a little bit easier you can go i can go pretty cheesy on de bars but polypary can't pull apart you need something let get strong you can bolted to you all but she needed nice pull up bar with a with a initial or a two inch metal pipe i still have a poor bar that i bought from a home depot ah i bought at nineteen ninety eight i've had it ever since and it's bolted on to my squarecut that's all i picayune two inch pipe and that's what do poops on so when you say it makes your legit wise that fell so doesn't break while you sing it basely yeah and also kinahane some weight to it he can do kipping pull up sir you're not the things not shaken all the place you get ye see these i mean it is just going total cheese ball of things with like the foam and the less that just rotate and fall off and then just at its just a night or you on a witching need is a pipe that's what you need is a piece of pipe from home depot a and and then you need somewhere to do dips now one thing that you can do that will cover both these as you can get rings you know damastic ranks in a and you could have you can adjust the height of the rings and you can do dips and pull up on rings and then you can do muscle up as well so rings or also like if there's a one thing you could have if you do not one piece of equipment for working out it probably be smart to go with just wooden ranks ah because that there of that flexible you can do that much different stuff men e can do depths you can give muscle up you can do pull up you can do push ups did you all kinds of stuff you can do levers you can you front levers back lovers there's all kinds of gymnastic really you an you could basically work for a rest your life on rings and be good to go so brings or a way of honting the whole poop and dip maritato but tin that's wife pretty much the number two thing for me is is pullural ranks because those are all going to kinda get you those basic body movements to build your strength a once you get past that now it's time for a squadra got half a squat rack and the sins you have a squarin squirmy squaw rock has a poupon it which i bolted on myself my squat rack is the same year of four we bore first house immediately had a garage is twenty and twenty seven years ago or something like that built a ragtime diately bar squat rack still have the same square both of a poor one it still have that i modified it a little bit and made gitars i had a dip an it this is before you could buy jam master resided n't know how to get old a gymnastic rings back in those days and then the next thing yet he needs he need um an olympic lifting bar and and bumper plates and so you can do your squats your cleans your clean and jerks you're dead lifts in all your basic strength movements um after that for me i think kettlewell um you know so now you have you can do your swings you can do your farmer's walk you can do your snatches you can i be there's a ton of exercises charges get up something there's a ton of exercises that you can do there even cannelton add to the situation and you can use some really psychotic conditioning metabolic conditioning with the addition of kennebec'll at this point if you only have one or orenian three sets of rings and i have won that's high for muscle upside one that's medium for depths and i have won that low for for push ups and i just have those old times the ooftish i guess i'm too lazy to honrados my rings all the time he the next piece for me is i like rowers the concept to rowers i have one of had it for a long time there bluteau i think that you can just destroy yourself very easily in very quickly i think like a like an air diner an air so tight bike i don't have one of those in progetto one very soon but i think those are outstanding as well i didn't say compiler that's another good kind of cardio kind of mat can kind o get after it and then maybe some medicinal um and after that i mean i think you know you that the question was essential equipment for to that sort of miles yes and in from their just becomes fun you know it becomes a kind of other implements can i bring into the situation that are going to eliminate board him increase a creativity increased dynamic and functional movement and i think these thesprot good and this is all stuff that's pretty common nowadays is a bunch of plot different places to get it made you happening yes tis she so you any kind of start with cinna one thing in slowly just add one and essential that kind of a complex swathing anyway to begin with and you did say for you rather it depends on what kind of jim you're doing like what kind of results you want you know well you're every one that's lessing to this podcast wants to just physical conditioning and a broad array of of confinements and asks right i would assume that is well but is not necessarily a fact though like i'm descending they have different gold but neale different name a golden won't be covered by this you can't they let get their bench up a citation in heaven eye won't give you one give your bechune the bench you yes i think ye're listen pretty elaborate because silami be in us younger break down sure like a man in monastier here and when i work and i nourished well a venal equipment right i would say the man depends so yeah okay for aid on yevan yes it depends on what you want results you on so if he just want to be a a body builder went with figues donnerent parcas that's that's a question i put the question and beverage his questions or was in his poncaser eating to visualise and to be healthy they want to be juitler they want to be fighters they get on the ida functionally moved well they want to stay healthy they are not yet just gettin their body builder on okay that's still is it a sumption though but correct eselbraten at least fisette a montagnana mallegeta make that you habinas well one minute to connie emotion about completing the list is going to elaborate a little bit more but do no i think that i i i actually agree with you you are a oiran to do are more than you probated avanother getaway you dot on anything else yet orienting that would thou be though it's the silicate the same thing a bench should facilitate hoheits pretty a pretty good list defer yeah i think that's the yeah that's a big temptation that's the dylalas though mensieur i feel the want of it you'll get your at each it an escalation now ye if someone's listen right now in a reconteuse first thing you do is get at a ring so you can do pulls in that yoraitia then you can get a square then you discorrendo with a poor part editor somehow so you're good there then you then you got to get the barnum plates a right which you can ask what you can start with a sorites the barn and you know to twenty five pound bomberette every month by another forty five pounds rondeaus or whatever in your going after you see those ganesan jack in the legeretie about em home jim is if you work out at home pesehiera you get more of a test otros if you work out at a adipiscendae twin for fitness or cross the gym or something which i want to give you more if you work out well basically if you work out in front of people if there's other people around you you get a tearoom polophilus it's catting um where another exersise guy to experiment on amager um out now hollooed experiment where he found out all these little things that you can do in front of people that all bosercanter one was a mitrie a car like a certain kind of car and if you do it in front of people it bossouet oscar so if you and not only do you get get that you get em psychometer priming as well so when you walk in the gem like the cross at jim all the smells the sounds and all that basically primes your mind and your physiology for work up so they think it at home i mean i'm i'm sure you could do that i don't think i would etretat actually being there just a part of it or must i home guercino in that at all you are not as when i walk in my home june yerrinbool bribe it a arises he in and that's part of it is well so am the whole reason the whoreson i set up a home jim was so tonale to make that drive to the gem and you know fisette kind of work could get interesting that you use the that i like i say hey i have a home jim so i can just be alone in the gives cavern of gloom at the pines get after it ootee can be alone in my vain world of pain and proving myself he and our yuteous outeat segantini trissotin i can see the higher the it which we did his efficiency thing for sure he and but that efficiently think him travaileth like for example i'll be like an i don't have to you feel like you don't have to get the most udowat to i can just come from right back here you know in an hour when i could unquote feel better or when i feel more like doing it or the vs right there and love yet the soever oiling time i friction the a i can be and if you listen for helpers for that discipline at home jim facilite way yes it is but geriers onally that i'm able to work out sometimes only because i have a home jem he toowith way in my time is it in a day or i'll get up cupoly an if i wouldn't bile to hit my own jim quickly in thirty minutes and get a work out an i wouldn't be able to get you taken thirty minutes just get your geminae yeah well i recommend if you make a home jim you do a positive way cressouson that's what i recommended yes i like it you know you're home jim kind of separate for my house yell here you have to kinda go you it yes i do get to scrape ye feel like that that's a big factor might as like right outside next to the barbecue doited little unaweers you want o ye leonicino on so that's eteoneous now his truserie a text class how catacausis ah how does it feel to do timariotes or reliances and get thousands of follers listening to your podcast a reading your book it sara do you worry that some of your fine place you on a pedestal and engaged in hero worship yes so this is a question that i was actually knock on a decus i was a little bit uncomfortable with it and then i was like okay why you uncomforted not that big of a deal it although i will say like eight does make me feel on comfortable to think of people think i of me in a heroic way or whatever ah that does feel strange to me ah as far as being on roguin in parison and sam arrison doing some of these podcast ah it's you don't it was there was really cool it's definitely ah you meetin people all the time that i travel and meeting people that have read read our book and and an got a lot out of it you don't i not that feels very rewarding you know it feels very rewarding holgrave with some ossian used this chapter or a your book i'm a people are saying that the your book changed my life and i take that with a grain of salt but if you if feels good felspathic you know i feels i like that you know at one help people and so that feels good but as far as it's not the edlins mediocre ence which i had tzeren i have it and it it's not believe that big of a deal because it's just me an i'm a i'm still use me and there's no there's nothing um that's different or has changed and when we talk about doing his pocasset talk about how we should act or how i should act to get more people to listen to it i'm only doing what i'm doing because this is me if and i'm not going to be different in order to achieve anything else i'm only going to be whoam and that's why the fought of people putting the unopened whatever the that i i know that i'm just person and and i think that it might be how how i get presented you know by the media aligern ed even on this pocataligo this pocataligo to you were talking about specific subjects that we are interested in and it's not you atelier someone might think old you know jocosity you know super human and and now i know i'm not so i come across like that it's only because you're seeing a sliver of me that appears that way that you know i'm not saying if i know i'm not totally normal as well i mean i know i am not a normal person i know him a little bit to the to the edge of you know being a little bit extreme yet a little bit extreme inness in some ways and i know one of that just as do with my habits as a person ah but the the fact of the matter is that no matter what happened in the marati come across and and no matter what people might perceive me as i don't perceive myself as special or as a hero for sure because in and one thing that will not but will that will always stay with me is that a bidding combat and i've been humbled by combatant i think that i'd been on the battle field and i've been confused i've been outmaneuver it and add my guy's killed and so i know what a will you hear a wit and it ain't me and that's always good keep me grounded and i will never forget that ye in you um is far as being worried about people putting you on a pet a silk like how you're saying you just you be you you and that's all you're going to do is to you you're not me trying to live up to any one expectation not that was never a goal of yours no so if some one has an expectation since that's not your gold to how can you worry about it you ginooine to be you and it is i think i don't know if it's a irony but the more you do that and just be just of antic or whatever it seems to draw more people to you i guess but i don't know because i'm not acting any other way that i acted a year ago an you don't for years ago i'm just on a do intrude your i work out i wake up early in the morning i trying get smarter i am trying to better yes you know that's what i do ye aso so yeah i'm just going to a koume and i actually i'll tell you this is interesting is that people that i interact with now i i enjoy it and i get something out of it i don't taking away they're given me as much inspiration as i'm given them if you know there's one girl on the on the on twitter and i don't want to say her name because i i mean it's a i don't know how i don't i don't like to destructory eveches on twitter but she's a a clearly a little bit of an older lady she's um she's a cancer survivor i manheim say old roman she's in her at least in her sixties and and she put a picture on the internet the other day on twitter of her at the gym and she's got you know like a kettle bell um a medicine ball and in oxyacetite game cause she is cusheen their work an hour yea and she is i got i bring my ostentatious of what you know i don't know no specifically why but a man he a she can bring on oxcitement the gym and get after it at you know age sixty five room seventy you don't that's inspiring said nan and i can get up and get after it and do my pace just you know just as jeeves as well as as she could and and so i think that that's all i think that's what's what's been interesting about this is seeing other people that are fired up and and you know that's that's another thing that kind of happened early on and this journey for me i have not a bunch of friends but what am i friends who to see when i was just about i think i had recorded the tim fairsome and i knew was going to be released and i knew it was going to be hurt by my people in when when i did when i got back i i taxed it my friend and i said ha ah i did this part cast and it's going to be released and i'm going to be one of them he when i meant by that was one of these guys that sold out for lack of a better word and all out there you know all am the navy see you and in the biggest battestina here's plenty of those guys out there and how i'm going to be one of those assisted i said i'm going to be one of them now sorry and he wrote me back and he said that's also and we got so many guys running around saying all kinds of stuff you should be out there representing you should be and he went on to say something even more powerful and he said you know what there's a lot of people in this world that dearlove that needed dad i needed a dead i needed a father figure and that's what you were for me eando you to go out there and be out there in the world and beat out romanete people it's awesome and you should do it and i love the fact that you're doing it yet and when he wrote that to me a kind of change my attitude ye because i did look at the remodels that people look at an i said to myself and in again i think potawatamie me a good roman that i don't think i'm a good role model as i'm still trying to get better and i'm in a kind of stupid stuff we need to have a dozen pot cast on the stupid things i've done in my life and and talk about the mistakes of made growing up and all the just i mean i'm that's anosin like when you when people see me on the pokaree on the pocket they read the book there seeing the good parties i would hesitate to say but there seeing the best part of me he seen a much surer person i'm not that mature but there seeing that there seemed the older than a curous that i ever been which is right now for not seeing the eighty it you know growing dome that i was in that many a lusmore we were younger venoit i have had a riddle add a little bit of vantage maybe ye wassaile bit o had in some cases for man i didn't you know ensouled i got that taxi was as serious to tax from oh from my brother that relieved me a different attitude on the whole fine and it made me feel more comfortable with the fact that i was selling out and i was now going to be out there in the public view and and all this being said at some point i'm probably going to go right back to the to the cave that i came from and minionet um ye don't i don't have what patina which you do like this huge desire to be famous i ve no problem not being i was unrecognizable to the world for my whole life in the fact that i'm a little bit recognized will now it doesn't make me feel great it doesn't do anything for it to i'm just just that you will what i do it's not a goal but there is there a gold to try and help some people out there yes and i think her not from that body of mine made me solidify that go little bit and again not this chian say he be like me no it's to say learn from what i learned from yet i did some tombstun through some stuff that most people don't have to go through so if you can take something away from it awesome you know don't worship me by any stretch ebullit work together and see if we can get better as i deem ye and you're a good like a sum allottees and the things that you say to a lot of it is now and then a lot of its not new right so and so this is one point where in the asometon may have heard before but someone you who is done what you've done and and think the way you think and do what you do right now you're the perfect medium for that for that information to get batonnin you know like you know when you're a teenager or something your dad does he did do something your monteau then when you go and then you go to your friend's house and then like he tells you to do it that exacting you like a iyo know you just it takes that same message but from some one who you can for like a bit better way putting it some one you can accept it from and so all your messages are perfectly and light with whom you are so there so like you so eager to accept them you know to like how you put the innouie yoost a picture of your watch every morning in your end of the work out setting and stuff that got em and your can your message um more or less is a get up every morning and get your work done get a work out in whatever and then you do in it and there's the proof right there so if you are just some does go we're got every day and you don't do it is like a song to her or how to tice so it people will get those messages and though till they in turn lize away more readily from someone like you give the messages that your your your essendine that's one too the whole broad casting yourself thing man is as totally understandable for for some one like you and that that it's good that you kind of got your kidogo turned on to the notion that it's more you have grey good messages and good content that will improve people all in their life with a be older people younger people girls guys everything and this is especially a pocassett on or even like certain online profiled stuff they're good ways to get that information out that people need men like the improve themselves like other if you are in an inn in a neighborhood or nivir ment with a bunch of people improving themselves that's going to be a good neighbourhood and if they have the means to improve themselves then that's a a good service that year putting out there in an end to reach as many people as you do your essential your helping the world with your message or a okefinokee broadcasting yourself is a good thing ye it's it definitely was a hard thing to do for come the abate aversion ye to broadcast yourself with a something that you know if i talked about what temperantiae about it with jeroen is this idea of people that are talking yeh and you know you look at the extreme examples of social media bournouses abusers and at worthlessness you know and i don't want to have anything to do with them and when you're when you're doing it regardless of how much you don't want to have anything to do with them be as on to do with a because you're doing it too and a very difficult for me not to feel like that now obviously i've gotten over it i mean i've gotten over to a point where i am saying okay these are kind of the acceptable parameters that i operate within for my personality rail which is i there things that i haven't done it won't do on social media for you know because i'm not there to promote me i am but i thereto only open a door of observation i will say not to not to knock on people's door and enter but just to open the door of observation and say this is how i try to live hum in this is the step that i take to try and live that way observed in and if you want to enter my house and hang out with me come on it is on as you like my didine have the same sort of goal then come on in and men you know what you're going to make me stronger if you're in a bulstrodes people now billposting pictures of their watches on my titania e up on looking at fallito a hundred watches that i a the men and i'm going while that's a lot of people and and that is unity and that is leadership and it does make me feel like a cacoethes other people in the world that are up and get after it yet here i say were one yes then tittered teacher put good youth understood on the dissidents class indoor man and till now he's you know specimen pushing that that those good messages to the kids you know ye so ye i mean it's all i think all potidaca media it is easy to get to get that attitude towards it because of all the people who have abuse it runcorn but you know like if you want an not like on the highway and in all you saw a people speeding reckless driving and still doesn't change a fact that ye you still want to drive on highway that as you have something to do you your your your pursuit is different but yet there's going to be an wouldn'ter weird you i've no idea where this is going ye and so like this pot gas i didn't you know we used to inedit it i went on with them parishioner did it i started to enter i had no idea what that was going to be if an so it's it's fun for me to be adventuring into things that i don't know the outcome of ye as is one of em and twitters one of them the book was one of them and you know i don't know what a round the corner next and i don't know where this is going but i will stay with the principles that i believe in to the best of my ability that i think that's what makes it interesting ride and where's that canna go ye will find out now lalage question joe what motive you i heard you mention the man in the cave can you go deep run this what motivates a well of talabot this before and it's kind of what we were talking about a couple of minutes goes well and that is first of all with the man in the cave and this idea on the stage the enemy and in that was a thought that used to drive me and can haunt me and make me get up early in the work hard to push myself because i knew that somewhere out there there was an enemy a real enemy a real man a person a human that was waiting for me and that was preparing for me and therefore i needed to prepare for him i needed to be ready i needed to be the things i always talk about i needed to be stronger and faster and smarting better so that wouldn't we did meet on the battle field i would be ready for that run dave for that meeting that fate that battle and that's thought that thought of the enemy yes it absolutely filled me and when i was a leader in the selkache of men it was even more profile because i was thinking about that rendezvoued that i led ernest charge of every one that i trained then i felt that burner of responsibility to prepare those men and protectors bosman knows those front men as warriors my brothers and it was my burden detraining and prepared them in an aberdonian may i made me a little bit queasy of it paranoid wotever the top but i didn't really know any any other way and though now i am no longer a combat leader i no longer prepare men for war so the drive and the motivation is from a different place from a solemn place the drive now in the motivation now is not really from the enemy any more now it's from my friends my brothers that's from those seals that i knew and that i cared about more than anything and that they sacrifice everything for us and for me those guys they gave their lives for us and now i cannot help but think and remember that every breath her we take is a fit gift is a sacred gift from those men every day we have every sunrise every thought and every smile and every laugh is a guest and i will treasure that gift that gift of life then i will not let it go to waste not one second of it i cherish every moment of it and i will live it i will live it in armerry in their honor i said that if the mottifont so as always thank you for lessening hankering thanks for reviewing tantor supporting the thanks were taking a moment to remember the brave men and the women that i fought and died for our freedom and in their memory make sure you get out there when you get after it till next time but is acojote out
