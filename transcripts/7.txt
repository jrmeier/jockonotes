this is jack podcast number seven with echo charles and me jock a willing am bush of dominating patrol at neony ne on queenie's a small village in the midst of the jungles and its extensive cleared patches would developing as farms the village had a couple of rice mills closed for a long time a school a dispensary and a small market next to the school the market was itself a road junction with houses and huts round northeast of the market a couple of comers away was the post of the i p c held and strength north of the market was a pond its rising ambat in bankment facing the post it had become necessary to dominate neumanii by day as well as night at the height of operations in eighty eight and early eighty nine thereafter dominating the market became a routine and a gospel for the next italian since the relieved battalion in its handing over notes had mentioned the same so the new batalion got into the rut and carried on without once asking why this action was necessary so much so that the new units dominating patrols even occupied the same trenches in the same fashion for the same period and checked the population in the same manner one change of made was to stop occupying the double the only double story building in the bazaar and instead occupy only the ground level trenches in the midst of the market the second change was to stop searching the nearby school another buildings where trenches and bunkers were made thoroughly before occupying them the third change over over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance in the market school and other buildings the battalion for months had not been involved in any kind of encounter not even caught or seen a mouse so this is setting the stage and in reading from a book called assignment jaffna which is about the war the long civil war you know a small country called sharlotte by a lieutenant general serge panda who was a commander there on the ground and what's interesting about this book it is a very rare book in fact i after i picked it up and started reading through it and i figured other people might want to get it my looked on amazon and it's no rare book that you have to buy from individual buyers and the reason that i have it is because i bought it on the ground intronati whin i was attached to a seal unit that went to shreelane to help train the trianon soldiers to fight against the to muleteers which was an insurgent terrorist group called the l p t the liberation tigers of time elam it is an ethnic group that lived in triana and ad been mistreated and had now wanted their own state so this opening of this book for the opening of the chapter that i jesrad about this ambushes catches a couple of things that i think are very important number one you are me say that the new battalion got into this rut and carried on with this mission without once asking why it was necessary and i think this is very important for everybody to remember that when you get past with something you need to ask why you're doing him an you to understand why you're doing something don't just carry on because it's the way it's always been done asked that question why and one of the things that i learned a very hard lesson on on my first appointment to iraq we would get you know we apart that would come down the chain and and they tell us hey there's a a bad guy this building and we were literally get a map of some area of iraq or bagdad or some city in iraq like baghdad and on the map there would literally like a like a like a cheese movie there would be a red axe on the target bildend that would be the building and we'd got at it and i remember one time we didn't operation and we went in took down the target the building that had the big red exon it and got the guy that we thought was a bad guy and any ways to make a long story short short when we got the person back and we interrogated him and went through the intelligence so he had taken from the house but turned up the guy was not about guy he was just a guy that had been the somehow mixed up with a wit with something that ended up giving us this court uncle intelligence and so from then on it in as i dug as i pulled the thread on the red axe i figured out that you know just some one had had free houses to choose from and for whatever reason but back on that house they had no real intelligence behind it and so i always would tell the story to the young seals and say you know find out who put the ax on the targeting and make sure that there's a damn good reason why they put that rector so the it's also going back to the to the paragraph that i started with is you could see that these guides were occupying the same trenches the same fashion the same period in the same manner so they are definitely locked into a pattern that is going to cost them dearly and it goes on to talk about the only changes they did make some changes but a hall the changes were negative or the changes were wrong for instance they did not geyte one double story building now any one that knows anything about tactics knows that you want to take the high ground you always want to have the high ground and here they were in this bazaar and they didn't take the one double story building so when you are a two story building and everything else to one story building it gives you you can see much further it's a dominating position you can shoot up the people much easier and so you you have to take the high ground on and there's a seal it i know that kind of took that fought and he had a great coat which was take the high ground of the hydrantine know when i talked to people about moral or ethical issues i used that very cloak the high ground or the high ground will take you so you know stay on the strait and narrow path sir going back to this honor routine round of the day's morning activity a patrol of about twenty god out of the post at daybreak ambled along the road to the rice mill entered the market dispersed into the different trenches and bunkers got into them and started a days dominating work and discerned dominating basically means there going to go out and in controller and that's what that's what this term is is referring to in the use this term of dominating a majority of the trenches were in the adorning the school premises the school was closed as it was a holiday doors and windows were locked from the outside attendants in the market was thin some shops had not opened normally they should have so if you remember earlier it says the third change over a period was to stop being inquisitive about the increase or decrease of public attendance in the market so it's like this stoobid old scrooby do cartoon where now they say what's quiet a little too quiet in a iacebat as is in this is something that we would see in remote you see the streets clear out if because the teocali populace would know somehow that there was an attack that was imminent i around breakfast all hell broke loose the doors and windows of the school suddenly opened fire and started and started in coming into the trenches and bunkers in front almost at point blank range thereafter grenades were thrown into the trenches as those few outside the school tried to react the militants occupying the double story building brought murderous fire on them below every movement was picked up the two inch mortar detachment which had stayed off and was still behind crossed the school was only with the old only element not hit or engaged i quickly got behind some cover and fire a few bombs then they too were picked up barely a few managed to get behind some building on the other side and kept a desultores volley of shots it was all over in the market but not on its outskirts so now you have these guys that had been in these positions and clearly the insurgents had set up on them compuny and just unleashed and in moments had the gun down the posts so the post is ware these guys had patrolled to this market from the post reacted quickly and sent a relief patrol directly to the school through open patty fields the militants had correctly anticipated it as you can imagine the militants knew exactly where the post was they knew when they had these guys that the they would send reinforcements here come the reinforcements there ready they gave a searing welcome to the relief party and pinned it to the ground the post orders have been deployed and fired on the bond of the coamin dominating heights of the militants had a mole the mavis the relief column the militant seemed to be enjoying it as they pumped automatic fire to the post itself from the near by jungle edge although this fire was more than nature of gesture of defiance so they not only were hitting the market but they had coronated that when the market when they started to attack the the the shrill or are indian soldiers in the market as soon as they started that then when that reaction force came from the post they had deposed his well as quickly as they had half an hour later the militant stopped firing as quickly as they had started it and melted away with the body of weapons from more than a dozen killed and wounded soldiers of the dominating patrol so obviously a horrific situation and this is where the general asks some questions some pointed questions what kind of training at this battalion done what manner of mental attitude no professional preparation had it achieved before being inducted into the battle field in triana what attention did its previous brigade and divisional commanders give the training and a tuning it before despatching it to sielanka surely it was forced to keep doing its station duties providing working parties for golf courses clubs sports events and other peace time activities senseless so what he say in there is that wales force was back in india instead of training what they were doing was you know helping with golf of tents and taking care of the local love sporting events that they were doing helping with the clubs cleaning up they weren't training for war which is what they should have been doing in that the domination spadassin square they have this is the guy they will not ready where the seal stood up resisted peace peace time demands made by selfish peace orientated peace oriented brigade and divisional commanders and trained their men van their units did well they saved they saved on casualties and sought the enemy so he saying that the thickening officers back in india that stood up and said look ere orcano bonacina man's the golf game were not going to do clean up the the the club over there were going to train for war those guys did well where newly inducted units failed and senselessly suffered the blame must square le and entirely fall on the unprofessional indifferent brigade and divisional commanders from whose formation such unit came as reliefs and tuloa it was a breach of faith all along so paints so very painfully callous and unprofessional even as late as the beginning of nineteen eighty nine so you had this the ipecac which the a m indian piece keeping force who has really fought no kind of different wars all over the world but they've been sent in to shreelane to try and keleton between the shrinking erment and the elite and the first of all they fought there any beginning the iceman a piece keeping michigan then and of not being in the end up being on a piece keeping mechinet the end in up in serial war combat in with with the tumpikes so it's these questions that he asked you know what kind of training did they have what attention was paid these are things that if you ran a leadership possession you should be asking yourself what position are you putting your people into and how well if you train them for it and if you have not trained them forth and you need to train them for it and also a casing where you are going to end up and this is something that when i was running training in the sultans i would always training guys for the worst case in erie in fact we would do we would set up operations where we tell em okay you're just going to go and meet with the local tribe a leader and read it you know we'd have actors that were in play local travel leader and we just want you to go in there and you'll drink tea with them and try and gather some information from him and so they go kay and if they didn't prepare properly they would get destroyed because of course we lord them in and sail yes the travel leaders ready to meet with you o great lormont the rome and then all of a sudden you take at a hoss did you kill him and these start so he'd cause total manbite point was you always had to prepare for the worst case arion that's obviously not something that happened here i'm going into another ambush it was a good unit had trained and prepared well before coming into riloka and late nineteen eighty eight it had well taped up drills the unit and subname plan their operations as innovative ly as circumstances permitted and took pains to avoid routine of these guys were a little bit sharper one of the biggest things you need to watch out for in a combat situation is routine and doing the same thing over over again and giving the pattern a padenie that people can recognize and take advantage of so these gasser trying to avoid that there on the slip up with that they did not take enough pains to detect the setting in of routine and inclination to find comfort in slackness and so that means they did a good job when they were fresh but once they started feeling tired they would slip into routine and they slip into slackness like complacence in complacent ing as a newly inducted unit the men were alert up and about and keen and for a long time nothing happened and this is something that people try to express about combat a combat is often a lot of lading and sometimes they pictures sometimes they portrayed as well and the intepeter in the better movies about combat they show you know these long periods of waiting and that can be what combat he is and and what's happening here is this you it is there and for a long time nothing to happening so when nothing happens you start to get more and more complacent in mid may nineteen eighty nine on a day when the road to elephant pass had to be opened by the unit one of the posts and rout detailed its botuto insure security how the stretch of road for a distance of about two comets the batoon split into four parties of six to seven manichean set out to search the road physically and secure in an area stride to it a distance of three hundred to five hundred metres within its given beak having cleared the roads these parties established squads three hundred four hundred meters away from the road from where they could observe the troad stretch and the area a stride it at varying en intervals one squad was to move out and relieve the next one and so forth the chain would of relief would go sometimes clock wise sometimes anti clackit this was the overcome boredom of word routine and keep mobilitate and thus dominate the stretch so what they're doing as they got their little squad set up and then occasionally once goaded to another squats position and that squadroned another squad disaster would just do that to keep moving keep mobile notecase the road had been kept open for the whole day for up and down convoys so they had to keep this road open because they were running convoys on to another area adjacent to the road ran the railway line too over which that day two trains were arun it would be a long day as all such road rail opening days worse of this is kind of a common mission for them to secure these roads and these railroad tracks to get convoys through to bring logistical supplies to other parts of the military the platoon secured the area and soltikov and the trains through by about ten thirty so tempery morning they gone by they would now have to wait for the returning convoy and trains in the afternoon the sun was well up in the sky and the men were being baked humidity added to the discomfort it was time for the squads to get up and move out to the relief the next one number one and number two squads were north of the tea junction about four hundred to five meters of five hundred meters away from it number number four and three squaws were opposite one and two respectively south of the road number one squad however over a period had quietly decided to reduce this distance and establish itself next to the tea junction in a thick cocoanut grove which had good shade so there's that opportunity instead of backing out the sun which is going to cut up get a little bit closer the road giubilo er the tea junction were nessitated the squad occupied the grove as it had been doing and relaxed against the trees it was comprised of six men they did not feel the necessity of posting sentries no guards were out the militants had noticed this routine so this whole time there being observed and you know it something you've always got to expect voice got expect that you're being watched about fifteen millmen militants with weapons solely drove of vehicle to the tea junction and went on dropping a few members at four or five places are round our sire cross the branch road opposite the unalert squad barely forty metres away then they occupied a few old trunk trenches dug by the ips during the previous year so here legis basically asleep and sitting this cocoanut and forty metres away i mean you playfull forties less than half a football field away you've got the insurgence gettin in position indicating that they were doing that on purpose like those therapia lorento sleep a little bit or a tajus kind of just now she complacency in ithout think it an i don't angiolina along the sweep sheathe were watching this area i'm sure that this was mary that they had done this mission before and so they probably sat there and watched them do this three or four or five or ten times in the past and when these guys lay a world state alert than they wouldn't attack a rider watched and waited in finding one day they see him in a hot day the wounded watched they see them getting complacent it is moving to position yes it's not like there waiting as the tactic like lit not do anything and create the feeling of inactivity so solitos epithets happealed to get one of etierine athenoe and over again and then every time that that swan was alert they just said okay won't put not on a hit him he is they had about when we were driving on my first appointment to iraq and we'd be driving round in her home des with no armorat slick comtes and we we would say look or protection as that were in a look of work were gontaud tuscain were going to be every one's going to have a gun pointed at the at the you know at a target somewhere wherever you think would be a target so that if a surgeon is going to attack us there there look at and say you know what let's wait till oatless aggressive convoy came through and i and it usually worked in well got to ambush a few times and and so took generally issue that that work of worse consider how often and wishes were happening is around eleven hundred a roundeleers hundred hours all of them poured bullets into the resting squad not one remained alive not one could fire back thus just then the number for squad which had up which had astruc from its location south of the main road and was going to number one to cation relieve it and red into the inferno the opening volley of the militants who were watching caught and killed four of this party too and wounded the other two just as they were entering the grove out of these two one acumen but the other who survived froze took no further part perhaps fainting desk and survived hearing this firing the number three squad which was about a calamite away rushed in very fast and was at the sight in less than ten minutes even as the militants were still firing the number two squad also reached the sight a little north simultaneously to engage the retreating militant this promptness was good but was not but what was not with that the two groups having connected or having contacted exchanged fire with the militants at that at the sight did not pursue the militants and allow them a clean break and they allowed them a clean break so these other two squads when the firing started they rushed in from two different directions and actually worn a good position to use a big damage to the militants but they didn't it is all the more regrettable because the two parties had contacted the militants from two directions and were thus in a position of considerable advantage instead all of them conversed on the site and started getting hold of the dead and wounded so instead of attacking they all just conversed on the guise that were dead wounded and started taking care of them but losses amounted to ten killed and one wounded the militant suffered one dead so again a horrible situation the glaring example of crass complacency on the part of our brave soldiers who neither firmly a cure to the spirit and content of basic tactical teaching nor thinks it's necessary to use that little brain god as given artagnan officering methods make sure that the soldier does not use his gray matter and develop a guile someone that part again or tchin officering methods make sure that the soldier does not use his gray matter and develop guile so what he say is the way that the train these troops and the how they treated them they get them that they don't use their they don't use their mind they do use the brain and that something that would talk about on this pocketable times was of going automatically wombo to try to make sure that the training that you do explains your brain and makes you think i told gave stories about how my goal when i was running training was to put these guys in situations where the only way out was to use the rank not to use their physical skill not to use the tactics et they already knew not to fall back on on their training that had been in bedded into their brain but to think of their own solution to a problem alcador that when you when you injure the second egypt when you see some one that is really masterful and you gito that person that you consider that is the person that you see get into position and they do something completely unexpected m that's the kind of training that i wanted to for people to put them in position with a half to do something that's unexpected and new and that they created nobody from the patrol could be punished those who made the mistake or already dead the dam shame so to talk a little bit about this book this book as i said it's called assignment jaffna by sardian lieutenant general seripando and here's his opening to the book i think this woman most honest opening to a lock up ever heard this book is an attempt to present the reader an account of operation poona considerable endeavour on military diplomatic political front in triana from nineteen eighty seven to nineteen eighty nine appeared of over two and a half years and this is where i think the guy is just beautifully honest i lay no claim to scholarship and research on the subject nor aviat ready at hand documentary back up the sustancia my remarks and conclusions i have not attempted to console others who were closer to the decision makers or even the decision making process itself i kept no notes no diaries not even not even compare notes with my peers colleagues or subordinates with my seniors i had been normal all too human quota of professional animus i did my job as i understood perceived it or sorry perceived and thought it appropriate in my post retirement glow i simply reminisce memories reserves as i did so not always with precise contextual precision perhaps but with sufficient clarity to heat up of aluminate and sea through this effort and this is something that i i went when i've run the the book that of always kind of hit me in the books that we've used in this pocasse are these books that i find value and and that's the books with kind of unaltered fought and its usually common from the person itself and that's a that's one thing that automatically does me a a a a negative impression or on a negative impression but i loved her in it the voice of the person that did it run i want to hear from that person is you is you interpret it sinamone else interpreted you know it's getting spun somewhere another intently or not there's a different view point and you this is something that i used to when we when we were running training for i was running training and you have a guy do something love of guy come into a room and you know this is a straining operation but you have a guy coming to a roman and there be you know what door way or a prisoner or a hostage and they would do something like goddam or crazy or wrong but you know some guys would tell you know going to again you'll go do that again and over we would definitely make him do it again i would always make them do you with what they did because they they they did whatever their instinct told them to do and what your instincts told them to guess what you're in tints were wrong now you still have to deal with it so i like these guys that that talk about what they did and as you can see from those first two you know stories this gustaving a what they did wrong what would what happened that he and his assessment of of why remontant nue it is the account of the happenings as seen through the eyes of a divisional commander who in the war in my opinion and experience is the main length between strategy and tactics and the main difference between perception and insight three on a good position he can assent was it you know how that strategy of what the what the goal was how he got interpreted into the ground and there are others who cherish mac relevel viewing and ten to underrate ground realities this is another thing that i always look for now of course i'm interest in what the general say i absolutely am always interest in what the president say and what the the the prime minister says and how the generals took that and what they did with it and those broad strategies on very interested that i was an read about that in what he saying it there's others that cherish the mac relevel viewing which is what that is the generals and tend to underrate the ground realities and i agree with him i belong to the former category mine was charmed a worm's view and i preferred that way meaning he is the guide that was on the ground and this is what he saw as he as if he was a worm how the ground that's how on the ground he was i knew exactly where i stood it is this that produced considerable disillusionment friction and differences with superiors superior headquarters and planers once again this is something that i always find intriguing to get these guys these soldiers people like haworth people that are dedicated you know life long military members and they get this twist of dissonant and suspicion against her higher headquarters i kept shouting myself hoarse but the juggernot rolled on unheeding so to spite the guy's protests and talking and trying to explain the juggernot rolled on unheeding there is a school of thought which says that mistakes were bound to be made in the complex and undertaking of projecting power outside or national geographical confines and that these have to be taken in stride to a look or an avesta es they're gonna happen we just have to deal with them and a move on but he goes on my contention is that if we consider ourselves professional soldiers and experts in concerned fields the no is no need to annouce for anmity omitting most of these mistakes after all it was human lives and limbs which would being lost we know we have an abundance of man bower even cheap human lives in this country but that does not give us the power of attorney to waste them and i think that i said amantha anybody that's been on the front line kin understand is that it's you easy to write those checks from the government or tom the the rear atala or from the safe place but those checks that your right nor are human lives and no one should write that check without a heavy burden on their mind there is a good deal of e in the narration it is not so much because of my ego to show up myself or to put others always in the dock but simply because is a compilation of what i as a cog in the gigantic wheel saw felt perceived and got influenced by the think it's interesting that this guy it is saying look o books about me and i apologize in a trying to be egotistical and actually a reading that right now i had now that on multiple discussions and have had about the book that lay on a wrote who were doing the same thing were like look if not it's you don't sorry it went it's not about us it's about what we learned and i think he's trying to make the same the same statement there shreelane was a fascinating assignment the most challenging of my life the most tense the most rewarding as he that anybody that's been intense combat will tell you that the most rewarding thing that they will do in their life i am grateful to my colleagues subordinates peers and our magnificent men steady solid as they are i have a high regard for the l tt for discipline dedication determination motivation and text and technical experts so there is a tocat the enemy and you ferd me say it on her as you have to respect your enemy and there he is he is high regard for the altegans discipline a dedication and determination motivation entertain expertise that's everything but find little justification in its senseless mulish destructive insistence on continuation of military means in the search of an honorable solution to the tool problem guana any goes on i think some of my erstwhile for helping me refresh my memory most of them took me seriously in war and remained two steps ahead of me in their spheres god bless them so like me looking at the guise that work with me and for me i hold them in the highest regard for taking care of me then he say in the same thing fashion apart i genully feel i must dedicate this personal account to young officer the young soldiers and the japetus who made me a good soldier and a better human being in my own eyes and i gets this announced adding opening for above now getting into the tactics on their arrival he goes on to say our tactics were predetermined straight jacketed predictable and reactive these rose only a little above what is known as minor tactics and military terminology that is tactical arrayment in drills at section and patonee counterin sergents operation demanded fallor innovative and integrated formulations at company battalion and formation levels this is obviously something that we had to deal with in re mody and that was this idea of counter in search any you know it's it's so it's infinitely more complex than a situation where you know two uniformed military groups are fighting against each other everything is clear it's very oughtest understand hothead a different shape helmet the different colored uniform and on the word on to get on our different sides of the lines and were going to go and destroy him and an insurgency is just infinitely more complex people mixed in with a populace a populace swaying back and forth on her they support wanting to protect the populace from the insurgents some of the populous supporting insurgents some of the populous supporting me the the host nation on the friendliest it's just a insistencies more complex situation how he explains it countercurrents remains essentially accompany in pepton commanders battle task to be saying that it is those front line guides that are actually going to make it happen however he goes on there conserved integrated mutually responsive and interconnected employment than man's particularized tactics at the talon and brigid levels and what that means is that the person who is over all in charge has got to do anantani job of explaining what the mission is and explaining how its connected and explaining how what is going to happen on the front line is gonna effect abroad strategy that getting that commanders in tent down to the front lines as critical missus something that when i was in remodeling for colonel shan mac follies now general marlin who was just an unbelievably outstanding leader but he was able to get his intent you know from him to the batalions to the companies to the platoons to the soudan right down to the front line leadership very very similar situation that cornichon was able to execute in a just a just out standing away so now we get to beyond that the strategy of beyond the tactics in an as we talked about on the last pot cast on always in trust me more is the principles of war and how different people in different situations he those principles and howells principles of war can be translated into principles of life and principles to business and principles of viting and principles of relationships and everything that your doing and really also the principles of the war within and the war that we have within ourselves to beat back the insurgents caterine you know being not in emotions that are remind that are trying to make us weak and try to bring us down and trying to keep us from being the best that we can be to those principles i war applies so many different things and that's why i find them so fascinating and luckily enough the good general as the section that's called principles of war principles of war distilled from conventional warfare are well known but their degree of relish relevance in insurgency wars is not the same again were talking on in certain much more complex insurgents is total war in the sense that involved people to in an intimate and positive manner in ploys all sinews of war political social economic psychological diplomatic and military it exemplifies determination and readiness for great sacrifices in pursuance of its goals it es amory tatiana a ergot it it exemplifies to termination and rennes for great sacrifices in pursuance of its goals so when you're trying to incivilities in a countersign situation is so hard to achieve it is so difficult to enchieve insurgency is an unrelenting low intensity long drawn war with time and opportunity serving the interests of the insurgent and wherein the insurgent designs to overcome his weakness and one's fear with strength in the others so in an insurgency they don't have tanks but they have time and any weight you out and making just pick away at you the death of a thousand cuts that's what the fear is in the etta's how the insurgent is going to win is the death of a thousand cuts in a when i think about me or you or us as individuals it's those little things it's those little cuts in so little time is a little tistle situations where you got yourself a little bit a flag and at the insurgent winning that seem sergeant beating you so the principles themselves relentless pursuance of the aim the elpit was clear and its aim and unrelenting in its pursuit elam and political settlement on its terms alan was the name they wanted to give the the state for the the to meals and that was their clear aim with no no other possible modifications that they wanted their own state period all the other hand we were not very clear about our aim destruction of the altering it if the latter then to what the gree we had not fought through the eventuality of the shockingness refusing to fulfil its part of the accord obligations we did not know what to do with a warning elite hostile population or recalcitrant teonontogen ment and as it finally turned out we were not even sure of what our national interests were and what military infant intervention and later military operations were required to achieve this is when you hear all the time about people in in right down your goals in this with a garden you got to know what you're going are you got to have em caller and then you got to have a relentless pursuance of the aim that's how you get things done and like people were like i got to get him better shape but that's it ye yeh yeh it needs to be a clear goal what is that mean is that a certain amount of running is at a body wait that you turn to read to strength goal what is that goal do you write it down do you know exactly what it is in is a clear next aggressive spirit it's an interesting how we keep hearing his word aggression aggressiveness in all these different principles a war of dress iveness is so important and what we talked about on the last pot cast and i talked about how it had to be balanced but it is be balanced but man asked be there that aggressiveness is got to be there in low intensity long drawn conflict unflagging addresses spirit is a vital and portance for more than inconveniance action the elp had realized it thoroughly and practised it with great deliberation and to great effect we were somewhat lacking in it in a way i think this insurgency in his talking about insurgency when were talking about life and becoming better is because it is a long term struggle rigou know um the the war of the the conventional war is a fast war where you you you know what's going to happen you know what you are you know who you're animus gone you fight him into tonterias the conventional i mean the the the insurgent war is more like what we go through his human trying to improve begining drawn out struggle and were we got peppino our brain that are changing sides just like a opoulos might in his very very challenging and that's why this notion of aggressiveness and knowing what your aim is and then this relentless pursuance of this aim and getting aggressive as you pursue the aim can you see how how amfortas are obviously in one in a counter anerton the situation but also as you develope your plan to become a better person in a better leader liability critical especial i mean one of the many things bompierre a comparison is the temptations that come up every day but at orferin i don't know make more money you know we are on business or or get in shape getting to us is a good one than solitude all about ye it yes yeah and a lot of parload he might pinioned clear so these temptations just like the insurgents till pop up or they won't be around for a day two days and then one day it's your best friends birthday and you know that he's going on on a duncantown out to something for you know his faris birth day and fardale he anserin attack me at a and they come up every day on a special for them the expected but sometimes not expect it fondest so dynamic in that way were all these things are there to cinget you and what's good when those things come to get you gianesi mind set will you get aggressive with that in washeresses with those donaldsonville fortieth yeah and that's so true and one these things do come up it's so it's so much i don't say easy i would is say easier to be like no i'm i'm i'm on the programmer now it's on your grassistrasse you're like you know amanala excuses to get in my head or kind of petipase foot around and be like well you know moderation is all right kind a thing and have that addition of yet you had as good er your grassette a stiff take in a way take pride in the fact that at no i'm not even to a ortuno i'm not drink i'm not going out to the club drinking i got a rush i got work out of the morning or whatever ye that it that aggression does help man badagrian delicate it's it's almost like if you don't if you do cindamine your way through it it went so yet ratafia yet it on to same thing with his with a countrier ency you have to be aggressive can't let those little things creeping to keep that relentless pursuance of the aim and you got to do it agressive ye next surprise this embraces surprise at tactical strichen political levels the itchiatuckanee could not do any thing could not do anything in in the tact colfield it was unable to match the elttil because of the lack of innovation and serious application of all professional acumen estimer sosimenes armetage largely remained conventional so surprise and how inportance how do we surprise ourselves i can tell you you got a surprise yourself if you if you can't surprise yourself i mean you lack creativity if you're not coming up with you ideas and new ways to do things your lackington your lacking surprise so nyoda was i been travelling a bunch lately and gesham in an hotel room and i got a gegrammenais pursue my aims in a ammynition know maybe my work out as three hundred berent's it loom no square there no pulupondan no rower nothing no kennebee now and gasha's gets crushed but that's just been creve and address of le adapting to the situations that you get put into m so you've got it you got a maintain that adaptability it creativity all the time and i think that's absolutely critical men in a flat on yet another one of those times of words so easy to be like danusia apocant oh ye when art or dangerous no like really healthy food or ratherthan right there yes there's no healthy food in this town even ye so that that healthy food thing especially when you look startling at intermittent fasting mou know ow you're in the airport and i don't have real you can get is those um those that dogs wrapped in a press those things are so tasty that but you know like you shoot not eating those right and sometimes you you are like a calway you should be on the armadas when you're in a travel situation yeah you don't need to be eating and i'm telling you this right now and it's fresh mairy cause i had two of those satsori and they were good yea the weakness crept in you a cat some of those retaliator and body's perfectly first sat next one mobility and flexibility the insurgent must have veloped must have eloped intelligent and guileful flexibility in planning conducting an overseeing actions so as to retain initiative suffer the least damage and yet keep the opponent guessing and in a prolonged state of readiness and uncertainty such the insertion has to do then got to be super flexible they got a cheap you guessing i keep you in a prolonged saturates at that that sounds good right for long said radiant sounds good posession nocard the when you you constantly on edge and that's whereas people down brings em down over time but where we failed was we did not exhibit enough flexibility in ostrogite plans and their guileful execution we had to see the initiative and posed challenges to the elite which we largely failed to do so you you know mobility flexibility something we talk about all the time on this poast is having the ability to adapt and be flexible and you know whether it's workin out no tell room whether it's you know finding something good to eat or not eating because there is nothing to to eat whether it's being a leadership such ation and your adapting to a personality that you that is awkward or different or you're not ready for more a situation that needs to be overcome that's flexibility in mobility you have to maintain that motivation and discipline in prolonged slow beating low intensity people oriented struggle motivation and discipline as ingredients of moral are far more important the alp and the people had both this to a remarkable degree the ipecac discipline was as good as any armies even the altis but its mode of nation was lined to the spirit of professionalism only we were soldiers we did as ordered so he elephantis passionate gold that they were go after m and that encouraged their discipline they understood why they were doing what they were doing and that something had that clear gold they understood why we doing this good we are roosten the the i pecan why they were doing what they're doing now they did not they just he just to bout that he just talked about how they could they didn't know what their goal was they did not how it was going to affect it didn't know they even know what their enstate was supposed to be so you take that away from them even though their discipline troops they missed that last level and that's why why are you doing this and that is why i sororities you try and reach your goals and you try and get something done you keep that in mind of why you're doing this what's the end take on to be consoles to lose track of the instatement you're trying to make you know your trying to get gain twenty five pounds a muslim that's going to take you a couple of years possibly if you're tryin make a million dollars that may take you ten years my take you six years that's a long way is no there's a lot o distractions in come a way yet into your point consider why why do you want to get twenty five months of the will say livingly ritto's lessay you're you have a a photo shoot where you goin on spring break or something we at that off let let me just think of all the big photo shoots at monowai tis no ravelets talk up this was all about your crinisus you're trying to be healthy here right at a long term gold it's realistic yes yenner that means right healthy um or or what of your healthy person already but you just want to ulloo better or or a chief something habington digitate nor coming and get effort cut some weight raiatea so it makes it so much easier to to cut them in front aweigh when you have a specific yeses so you got a fight coming up dittoes gontaut that way way quick yes you hear these guys cutting all this way i've all you he has a fight in all montana half and he got a cup forty pounds when the nodot you gassendist athletes as well but that that goal and understanding it man helps so much deiseal when amorites part again in an again we talk about when you're trying to get stuff done as a person it's a prolonged slow bleeding low intensity people or'ter that's what it is that's what your pickets man no batirton it's a low aanything that's a word that shaving as a person eighties all those it long it's slow is from you now there's nothing you go this is going to be the ultimate chief me of my life in i continue fifteen minutes to do no footage you months in monson montan years of effort of blood sweat and tears to get there now continuing with discipline a moral this goes into a section of the book where he starts talking about their performance and we take a little bit of a of a turn here but i think it's important to bring up in the initial stages of the war in october to december of nineteen eighty seven there were complaints and reports of rape looting and wanton destruction indulged in by the ipec what a soldier is pore and led into a blind alley like the situation in jafnhar it suddenly changed from so well tom tommed peace keeping up rations into a full fledged battle field he feels terribly insecure and start seeing an enemy all over so we talked about the earlier these guys out there going a nice peacekeeping mission and they put their blue on its on and you know be a referee well the referee the gets attacked and this is startet about the psychological effect it has and they start seeing an enemy everywhere you know in this reminds me of when i was nice school and and i was bucking to have a bunch of a vietnam bets that were put me through high school and when i was in highschool the movie pusson came out and of course i was you know you all in the war and what not so i went and saw the movie patton and one of my teachers that was in vietnam had seen the movie as well and i i asked him straight up you know an what do you think of the movie and he explained to me universalia that the movie depicted these americans going in and you know bruteling these villages and in you now doing horrible things to these villagers but he the way he explained it to me said listen you we'd be in in and around a village for three or four weeks and in that three or four weeks they the americans would lose seven or eight guys to buy traps and meanwhile the villagers don't hit me boottops said there are walking the same trails and the same areas through the right same rice paddies and the the villagers aren't hinneras they're not getting blown up their knocket and killed so that means they kind of know where they are and he said that kind of frustration as it exactly what this is talking about right here in an in england back to it in an insurgency spark and sustained by an opponent who is dressed in civilian clothes but shoots and blows him up on the scene suspicion alone takes a vicious turn when he sees his comrades being killed by innocent looking civilians blending again into the saline population he gets into a rage and anger against the uncertainty and the unseen at that point his pentup tention welling feeling of helplessness and burning desire to explode into a release of canterville are in frantic search of a tangible object he can master an object which is weak and helpless itself what better object than a frightened weak cowering woman and ungardened an unguarded wide open shop and unresisting the fenceless house and its feeble occupants whose shelter the unseen deceitful opponent had obtained by one of her means it is madness the animal in him that rules momentarily he is wild but just for a brief spell if he can get a hold of himself or some one controls him in that moment of crisis of catholic explosion he might know a probability get over his baser instincts where this does not happen then the explosion manifests an manifests in camera rate lot and an destruction seeking release from tension fear and rage education motivation communication and company a good anecdotes endoor most culprits realized within minutes of their act and repent weeping like children i saw an officer with twenty seven years of service breaking down like this so that's what happens to people i think there's so much in that paragraph this this paragraph about this pent up tension and we've got to remember that its extreme in no situation you know like this and that the tension is extreme the fear is extreme the rage is extreme but i in obviously for those that are listening at a in combat right now that are deployed overseas tetering that ye you have to watch out for and especially the leader you've got a peep bethe person that controls him in the moment of crisis of cathartic explosion as a leader that's got to be what your job is and also as you work in business is as a leader you've got a sense now the things won't be as dramatic as this but you can get people that do make mistakes and business they make ethical mistakes they make more moss excite fearlesse and they want a lash out any make mistakes i've got to get him through those moments you to pay attention to it it is under these circumstances back to look at his under these circumstances of total uncertainty initial disorientation sudden violence in ability to communicate because there was language differences and lack of effective control and education that excesses were committed by a few by a few but the command and leadership chain rapidly gathered their brood once again within the warmth of their moral influence and disciplinary binding inquiries were instituted and disciplinary action taken against the defaulters warped mind had to be weeded out but there were not very many after february to march of nineteen eighty eight the incident rates dropped to almost zero so they were able to get controlled the situation to weed it out get rid of the sanest and the folks that couldn't control themselves but this is the the type of pressure that you see military people under and especially in these countercurrent operations like we've had for the last ten or fifteen years in iraq in afghanistan where you have a local populace you have a dose you have indirect fire mortars and guise are getting killed in where do you place the rage where do you where is it come out and that is a a huge challenge four for leadership to try and keep that in check to the best of your ability and speaking of leadership from the book what we lacked in many an instance was what i should specifically emphasise inspiring leadership if the leer particularly the formation commander did not inspire his command then that body of troops would be at half its effectiveness so late an i tolabon tetrameters ip rest as most important thing on the botfield and heres another example of saint ellean that if the leader is not inspiring there in a half the effectiveness for instance if he visited a post and the men did not talk mearly inquisitively and fondly about the visit for the next week or ten days and if they did not perceive a challenge left behind by the commander not feel a spontaneous desire to meet it in thinking it hard to sal and finking hard to solve it in barasingh present it innovative novelty to the commander on his next visit then it is benset that this type of commander did not visit at all so these annual fear not an inspiring different spiring your people as better not even show up and many formation commanders failed to inspire not many of them a rough it out with a trees on patrols and bushes staying in their post at night on rode opening and ray roland in missions and this is an example of canovae example in this is a very good etesiae in it moves about vietnam aladdin you'll you'll get that very crickly the brigade commander would land by a helicopter and opposed on a heloped which had to be secured from insoles had to go out and like secure this hole pad somewhere in catsuit around it moved the brush and make sure there's no minds on it et cetera setter then the general would breathe past a few bodies lying in the muck and mud being a flashy smile to effect unconcerned for danger have hurried chat with the local leader blowout directions or orders sipapo tea or cocoa juice showing no concern for the soldiers who labored under those circumstances to prepare it and offer before you could blakeney would be often his chop is chopper what inspiration could his man in the post dragamore tipical thing and it really adds it really does happen in you you see that with a you not just military meters but you see that with senor leaders and big companies where you know the the folks on the front lines on the construction side on the main manufactor plant the bosses coming so what have they have to do all this preparation to get a clean everything got a guttering died and and in the guy's shows up for five minutes and it took you know four hours to get everything ready to guy shows up her five minutes quests acumie then lay its is any one inspired by that no tasselly not m we had three types of officers one category was that which thought acted moved about was bold and got down to business fastest even in totally alien confusing a known environment yet now the business that's the guy the second one consisted of those who had the brains and ludebat as best they could but lack boldness and ability to inspire the third category consisted of those who simply slogged when traded and complained about their true not being trained orders not being clearly given and so on they could do nothing else their unit suffered to lap the guy that doesn't take ownership a lang and his vizier that and plain about their truths not being trained warders not being clearly given it so on that guy's not a good leader little enunication that is the words went clare complained up and down the chincoteague lonely ae'chen rideau's above me ar'give clear workers this guys of disaster don't be a guy don't be that leader and here's a piece song leading from the front they there was a big battle and there was a bunch of friendly casualties and now going to the books there belongings dress and equipment lay tattered and strewn all over a huge playground and i went up there on one of my visits i thought this was disrespectful to the brave souls and asked the scortea accompanying me to help pick up all those items and remove them from public gaze to my acute horror not one of them moved to pick them up the escort consisted of all denominations but none dared so so here we iadeste is all you know dear and and personal effects of all these guys that were killed and it just been sitting there no one moved it and a tekell the team mates with like okay sir gozaranu to gear and an won't do it it became painful to see such reluctance i spontaneously got down from my open jeep walked up to a pair of pouches and a belt and picked them up brought them to a jeep and then the brigadier general that was with him did it as well as the next to do so it was only after this at the rest of the escort team got down and gathered the other items little bit of leadership from the front letdown i think we're going to close with a section right here yes and visit the senior generals and their interaction with field commanders and troops did to little to inspire us subordinates provided little word world worth while guidance and clarified little as to what the whole glad game plan was about so these guys had no idea of what the why was everybody lived and fought from one day to the next no strategic view or wait for pearls of wisdom remained endless on increasing we showed up instead with the political eye and bluster of the generals the tentativeness and uncertainty of the army commander above them and the army chief which did little to change systemic in conduis and tackle the hidden rock consequently boldness and experimentation became prominent casualties so this glaring eye from the senor leadership snuffed out the creativity and need boldness of the troops actually made you know this this intense scrutiny like i said it made the troops not on a denying and i think not only should you keep that in consideration as a leader that you make sure that you're not snuffing out creativity from your troops but also on a personal level you can't let the fear of failure limit your boldness in your experimentation rent and that something that happens all the time people are afraid to step out and try something new yeankton as before where a lot of the time the reason for that is one people get punished for making honestest e e you you definitely should not punish people for making him honest mistakes and when you are going to take risks yourself you need to cut yourself some slack and realize that things might know what not go perfect hum and i'll tell you a man a example that sitting right in front of us right now is this pocasse talent because you know people are asking you know hey you should do a poncas but there is you know okay we'll wher's't gon to go do we really want to do it what's the one people actually going to think of it you know it's one thing to have do upon cast with a guy like him fares or joe roe in or sam harris where you got this you don't say is individual and of course people want to listen them but who's goin to want to listen to a joconde so there's some you know let's but but okay with the worst thing a cabin we fail nowness assuage cool it wasn't going to affect me that bad you don't read move on intrigue something else do yer but that's the kind of thing that that experimentation that can lead to good stuff an and if you don't allow yourself to do that then you're goin to have promenade same way if you don't allow your troopers to make mistakes like you said and trying to things and you don't encourage that then they're goin to be the moral's gonna be crushed and they're not gonna make the progress that the need to but toned make ye man you can pantaloon at at that type of scenario in or from like an expanded point of view like the big picture where someone is not raised a cinemation this before as well where it some one is raised in a really rigidous hold where you know that the key to stakeman lessons you make one wrong keen a gets waked with a ruler right and let's say it's someone was just raised like that and like every little mistake they are going to be so reluctant to start something new they are going to be so scared and a lot home to you don't even feel like you know why you're scared it's just just it's just scary a lot o anxiety comes when you think about or consider branching out doing his someone fear of like failure and all this is so embedded in you because of that punishment that you received for your train you know you're trained to avoid mistakes or new stuff that you might maintenant we've dealt was in the military for a last several years last probably a couple of decades was this we we called a diszernment lity and were as like okay of this if this if this guetapens over his career he was not going to be exactes not going to be promoted and a reiterated move away from that because like you said that completely suffocate any type of riscatto creativity many willingnesse the box and try something new it in just suffocates i was definitely never a person that would hammer people from making the stakes long as they were well called good mistakes are just not just making stupid mistake albing careless in general when you know being airless as bad ye so that kind of wrap up the book assignment jaffna by sardis penponds drato and i don't know if you get a hold of it but these are some major lessons that i learned from it and again i bought this book while i was in treloar and read it and i definitely influenced me in and as i sorted fighting a counter in surgenor myself i would think about what they went through and out difficult it was for them and i knew we would be excising some very difficult times as well ye that's been jesting that is a senate when a big way the opposite of yearbook where he's east bit vistaspa honary tale from beginning to end just how not to do it ye in although and you know for for for our book arbocala of this was a mistake that we made here's a weed wrong now strigil overall it it was a very successful you know what the army did and what the one when eighty did now what the two to eight was all these soldiers in marine stead over a longer period of time with with us seals as well was successful over all but we definitely point out the hairs of our way because there are successful there's successful operations out inedites bockas welladay don't lanius from a iridaceae the of the ones that went wrong leaners you one more from your mistake and you know and in the book that lay for i wrote it definitely a lot of the stories about the mistakes we made because we learned more from him as his brutal as that is that vellicantur he getting a questions as i do in say if i did this pronounce tly pronounced anything from a simon jaffna since you rely apologise my bossoir tell with that we'll go into some question from the inner lips though perspection from deidad jocelyn how do you deal with fatigue but mental and physical how do i do with fatigue mental and physical rest and ah you know when when if i'm feeling like just completely overtrained and weak i usually tell well tell my fighters i say hey you just got your but kick to day go eat big stake to night take them or off you know you just need rest and and it's pretty obvious from that happens in witness i do the same thing for myself if i if i'm feeling horrible and you you know you can see lickity workouts consist of like you know doing some mobility training ronow you know doing the big stretch that's cause i'm just tired and i know it and so i just give myself some down time um i think it's very important to know that difference between being lazy and bein over trained and it's very easy to make that excuse for yourself and that's why i always air on the side of a morganatic because an usually then the next day i isopel like exhausted to day i won't take her off but i will take the next airpower out to the just to make sure in that are not to be lazy you know do another work out get another training session than to whatever the case may be said make sure tis not just that mon cause i'm mestastasio apatatam goin to get em back in the game yesapan the eh the other thing people ask me all the time i probablie this a dozen times or more on twitter is do i take nosender is yes in fact i supped on the eye flew to day and i slept to two hours on the plain um the etait more than an appinion a plain every day so what do i do for apeste naps what i do for massiest that i learned from my high school teacher that i had was i walked into his office one day he had his feet up on the desk above his heart and as i you know what you doing and he said all this is really good for you for your feet above your heart and it allows the blood to circulate out your feet and gives you know let your your veins and you one way olean your veins rest a little bit and gets little pools of blood out of random places and is any good and so i tried it and it so really good and so when i was going to see it trinitarian and we we have a comandante evolutions and i just go in and put my feet up semyonov sleep for a few minutes you know nowadays if i can i'll try and sleep through like six to eight minutes set my time or on my eye fondant you look like distress when i said sixteen minutes yet you don't consider anything under the three hours in a heavyhearted him it not this eminiki i sleep for like an hour then i'm up for too long at night and won't be able to go to sleep on it too much rest got you yet under what circumstances are egona a nap though like hungadi immersed all see myself like no yes like fleeter and that's the thing is i can do if i'm at my mind is gaganini ly my body's and agin something that's what's coauthor an now you can work out with your tostatus once you start bovinator in fall sleep while you're doin squaredsika seapool up fires going to do the paps to you got do the squat on we get down you'll be tired you go sleep is what's hard to do in his when like when we were right in the book when i was right in my section the books have be righting t eleven o'clock at night twelve glockett be trying to hammer through it and as a monsoreau you know before a sleep man so but that feeling of hay i'm just fallen asleep that's not good all so i'm feel not tired all all power not put it like one of those things where i also like to push through it so some of the tripoliticus honesty even of even a short nap for me well kinda make me stay up too late at night and all of a sudden we want a clock to morning have you any six to eight minutes six ten minutes to six yet minutes a pound at a sixty minute power avenae you feel amazed all a asiae you feel amazing don't underestimate the power now it in ledgewise yet actually tusita like fifteen minute now like tellinidae and now that's over nitromite loose in intulissent menes yeah you brosette yet outstanding on but it only helps with it that sleepy type because let's say i am used to a certain monolithian a half hours of lesseps than i'm used so it goes away beyond me feeling his sleepy tired it's like musically tire oh really yes so it has atesorase your different from so if i take a ten minute power not on it and lacking two and a half hours of my poetical knollaert no no no no no no it helps me when i get my normal sleep give her take but i've been doing a lot o stuff during the day you know and you're like doing i did a lot my brain was cut a used a lot and take no have this whenever i got to do now and you take the ten fifteen minute not entering your right back there and it typically will not mess with my she i wonder how much of this is you is just you just not just our inthrust up yet probably all of it but animales that's how it is yemassee resting to and some point for you to experiment with like bacalan sleep that yengeese how well you can perform like i've been noticed in that where i find yet a lot of see i con stolper really well yet at some physical activities in and inate a few days though i do i get feel like garbage friand no we some physical activities that will feel just weak at but yet in in your right there the eminent it's like one time or even to times oratio if i fill or something and let's a film in the morning but then i've been up you know working late the night before when i go in to feel mo like charge on i'm sure there's all kinds of factors in their lot of its lights like a drearilie it's like this huge adunaro but there's that little bit of a dreading because of the task you know so that helps and am a lot of him just like i you said if i made the decision like no i'm not going to miss this work up at all under any circumstances than i happen to get to an afoursaid i go in and i all you see power through it you can an eatin totally do it ye but i'm steinheil as for sure but i eldership but the answerest yes if you're tired sleep if you need rest rest and don't try and over trying yourself you probably are overtraining and and just needs some rest i next um we don't have an author on this one but um well what are your thoughts on freakishly strong dies in dejeja who go to hard get her an paintiness your fault because this caroled with the maniac and a rigid it rolleth maniac so we've all been there a lot o with a maniac okay so this is a theses like a prestati question at first but then almost sunniness really complicated it really does who is it fallere right so you you wrong the guy guy superstrong you catch him in this submission and guess what he doesn't want it to hal and so the next thing you know there's a little pop there's a crack whatever and you got an injury and the big guide that was going on crazylooking a polite you did this so a question is those it fall and there is actually to side of that story and a lot of ways because in from one in one way the higher belt right or a more experienced guy she never we we hurt a lower belt right i mean if if i'm a black belt a going to git poenel i really shouldn't hurt that person because if i do i've tolable meant to do it i mean of course there's you know mistaken and i'm not talking to him talking about submission right i'm not talking about a i i i went over in a major role your ankle or you caught your rest as your fond outer something that those are just incidents incidental you know things that happen and yogi but you sir to the higher belt generally shouldn't be like putting some one of submission in huneefa's experienced guys in jugera know when the tension is there on the arm or the foot or the knee they know that that tension means the next amount of pressure is going to take this beyond the limit of the joint and there getting have an injury so either they gie he's going sicond he's got a big ego and that's why he's not tapping so so that must be his fault right well at the same time if someone doesn't tap and then you hurt them well that's kind o jacked up to because you should be getting some one to a foot and cranking or getting her ormandine you know i mean we they couldn't tappeth were almost stockowner now will sunnyhopes i i really do think it's both i think both people rarefaction think that the part of the duel safety mechanisms is jugeant is that there's two people that the catholicon but one that's getting submitted should to pan the one that's doing this omission he should you know should know to stop before the injurious and again there is a there's about a million little things accolade where you i entrenchers gets thrown on an it's ilil tweak and and that that stuff does happen you know but but when i look at deaniness man tranparent turn with for twenty years we we've put you will asante rally so sands and thousands of submissions on each other and neither one of us has ever heard the other one and neither one of his ever gotten her from a submission and talking thousands of submission of course most those you know many of those most of those are him submitting me but i mean i submitted him many many times as well and never have one of us got a submission on the other one and her inversion tell you he's let go of hundreds of submissions on me and i've let go on many submissions on him because i go into an all i've got this he is you know he is not tapping for wherever isagoge next move or he gets me in some weird position he you know he's got it but he's let's go and go suset move and what's really cooled off there is what you enough with his you interpret ego free training because the truth of the matter is i don't care if dentate and i don't care if i cappen like and he doesn't care if he taps me and he doesn't care if he gets the tap from me so what we are able to do then is take all kinds of risks and do all kinds of crazy flow drills and and where we're really trying to get each other but at the same thing we lay don't care a and and and the biggest umtiko of that is i'm sitting here saying i don't want to get tapped there i don't care if i can tap by dean but a triebe crazy when i get tapped remitters me crazy going hear you some of the gimlet frustrated because i got to have it but it it's frustranea myself and it's for station in the game and whatever but it's not it's not my ego being like i didn't want to tap it just to bouratian that i made a mistake or whatever so that allows you to to really lomore now all this being said if someone just a big man achates crazy the whole time in the entereth you will it you got make it division as you're not going to othman men clearly he you want to not get hurt you want to continue training so some one that's the goes crazy and is super strong you don't want a roll of him that being said and this is one of this whole thing has been a non answer isn't that being said because i when you do that you've got to understand that you're avoiding a real issue you are avoiding a big strong gun and how he ideal with that guy and he in you will get better dealing with the big strong guy that's what makes you that's one of the key things i get you better as you giuso you know it you you you want to train with a big strong eyes but that being said once again as if you train the big guide you get hurt i can't train any more i see got to be smart you got to use your judgment um you got a check your ego you got a roll of people that have their eagles check um an i think that's that's the best way to answer that's a long answer it's probably not the most complete answer but there is no clear cut answer because there's a lot o little new ones yet i have re little roll and the eugie's like this so many exceptions to to all these situations even when you say i belt should never hurt a lower belt umilisima can just depend like what if you're not that much higher and he's bigger than you more athletic and when you go first submission really controlled her whatever he spasiteli the so even in your treditions he spasiano really though the the only way you can get that submission is if you go of fasteners saget ing all apparet on rank and listen you do it and in the midst of your arm baryu had in the midst of you slapping it on you can extend it to much who you heard him you know so it's really distante of the role and lotties but his thought hesus how to gus going crazy who care about the omissions are getting it happens and you enuity you shouldn't care about so much about the emission you getting at bottom wise well unless in in great great breath is up where he said he should care you should care about the submission you get and you should care about being able to resist the missions as well because it's kind o your refines was re this wouldn't understand the contact were talking with talk about a mean in him a hen we guide that that i i was talking about i was rolling with he said it's your job to give them an accurate look if you're a big guy who has now you come in in your you know however big and athletic you have to give him that look and you have a certain skill now when did you think you got to give him that look so you provide an accurate experience of rowing with a guy whose you know twenty fifteen pounds brownloe to give it that the another certain who you say you can't go easy you can't go easy you can't umanuh you can't he saying that but if you put on a submission and that guns not happening he's just giving you an accurate look that you are submission isn't submitting him you're not so many a initiation if you stop in like the pain or or is not scared of the pain will absolutely giving you so you have to complete a move a or not going to break his arm if you have that that might set that's good too but then you have to work on other situations that you would do in that situation luff you wanted just control the the the fight more or or something like that than that's what you got to do but it is as justiniana is something that demon i will do that i think is awesome is let's say dan put to hilary and instead of cranking it in making me tap killoleet and we hold it it gives me opportunity to work some kind of escape now so limesol it and he while he is holding it he is adjusting his legs he's actually getting me deeper and deeper into her i can't can't get out any more that eventually i realize i can't move and that not megathere sure not to pay because i realize it's it's checked me and a game over feste same token is as he holding it if i can figure i have ten to think in considering all worterleoo with i grab his arm here what if i spend this way or that way and all of a sudden a real escape opens up but i had time to think about a wom maybe next time i do it i don't have to think and now we actually have figured out and escape from the position ye and ane or either i forged out unticare or maybe he figured out the way to finish it with one hundred per cent reliability right so we actually have advanced the the let that's probably the original advancement in the leg lark game for for dian and me was and really for for dean more than me was him holding us submission and not an outlawing me to try different things to escape and shutting him down and then eventually were i okay now i've met you this worster's no escape as an that's how all things like we enduites for leven and oplige all that stuff to from holding those positions because if he just walked them on an tincaneetis than i appenine started again but rene didn't have to adjust inything and now you start building technique on it opposeetion ique next question and the quoting is here please can i had some advice with dealing or please can i have some advice for dealing with poor leaders at work they have lerisco and the question as a subordinate how you handle leader who leads from a place of ego and isn't transparent with him formation yes these were a couple questions actually that i got and i i just kind of bunched some together because my answers going to be very similar for each that an it's actually very similar to a situation that i'm doing it right now at a catman out and i wrote em something to him recently and what happened was he in a situation where a a leader come in that didn't have the knowledge inside the industry they were working it sir you came from another industry got put into leadership position and that guy that new leader was resisting change and not giving support to the new procedures that the guy was coaching the thin implement so he was kind of you know at a loss for what to do you know you got this new man jervis coming in that inexperienced and i and the guy in coaching obviously doesn't respect him because it doesn't have a lot of knowledge in this industry and so here's the advice again i said you need disentis up to make the new manager look good make some adjustments to the words you are choosing the tact you are taking and the focus you are using to insure that your changes make him look good not bad not as is so countering tototo people it's so courantes they get that person that the bull then the chan command that does know as much as them that nateswara them and would they want to do the one to bring them down for the want o proved to everybody that they are better come better than that guy they hereinto guy to i deserve that guy's job that's what it everybody then think is to do and it's wrong it's wrong somehow let the ideas come from him or make him the approver or the driver of some of the aspects that he can handle so i actually saying go out of your weightman this easier for this guy make him look good give him credit it's your eagle that wants to pull him down put your goinge how him without being come the sending or acting like you know more than him he shouldn't even know you are elping him if you were been this is so fond to do is when you know echoes n't know this section of the equipment so i don't say a since you don't know this um i'll teach it to you rineham descending at hone of you know but instead of like hay have you ever seen the witness one works i know you i've hearse this specific equipment before cause the way horsetend then than some of the other ones as you got to do this this and this that you can sit back and you can except that knowledge may without feeling like you don't know it be so i'm teaching you but i'm doing it in clandestine manner and that's a er trying to do as we're trying to build otanethi a relationship here that's ishida which i am buildeth and if i go since you don't know how to use this i'll show you now what is that do put you on the defensive makes you um ah considered me to be a threat now i'm threatening and that's not good he should even know you are helping him respect to what he does and show him that you respected so a now i nosolio the weeds on the type of gerna while but a this is the way you don't asinaio actually i actually respect the fact that you are up top in large and i'm just a front line guy but here's i do this if he ever add to right right you know what i mean just down play what he doesn't know and suddenly help in de learn it right you know you probably wouldn't he have to do this this this new equipee here i mean i know it a little bit below your level here's out work so you ever needed it to you on what i mean not like you don't know then do this i owe you no you don't you don't want an adversarial a relationship with this new leader you want him to support and help you he will do that if you were making him look good he is so easy man this is so easy and so heard the is everybody's eagle would get no way an everybody delegating way extreme ownership often requires hover and clandestine indirect actions so all these things it was alkinous helping the guy without him knowing um up letting him take credit for ideas without him knowing all these little aspects there indirect actions are not going to head to head its like you gietterowane everything's git you don't want to if you know him i now no bar i'm not going to get the armor right you're going to defend that so i have to go take indirect actions and set things up and take my time and be clandestine and cover this is chest not checkers this is where you need to master your ability to influence which as we talked about a lot couple of pocasset ally manipulation in a manipulating this guiding that he's got something over me i'm inflating his ego imputing my ego a check on making him feel like he is even better and it makes him feel good it makes you want o support me because i make him look good is this is just basic if you do this wrong the new manager will resist you at every turn if you do this right he will be your biggest supporter now this is the same thing with leaders that you corcoron respect for all there should be something that you respect about everybody everybody that you meet you should have some kind of respect for them and by the way if you don't respect some one what is making you not respect them it's your ego it's your eagle that makes you not respect people cause you think oh i'm better than them i should have the job be don't know what they are talking about and i do mum that's all ego an so put your ego and check and just be like okay this person's above me bessemer ence be at kien from now to day get there if they are so dominated his job how could they outrage me let me learn something from him let me learn something from them as put your ego and jack and this is the key point and any time i talk about cornuque leading up the chain i command i will talk about this that no matter what boss i work for i work for every different kind of boss egomaniac cite o passando guys intelligous brilliant guys tactitians i work for every different kind of boss and i always had the same relationship with all of them that was my job was to build at latinship in that was a balaton of hirest so they trust me there is stout of my way and let me do what i want it and that telyatin which by the way when you win they should never know you win they shouldn't even know that there was a competition happening a and that way you can do what you want and so that is how you deal with people above you in the chain a command that you have little respect for or that lead from a place of ego you build a relationship with them you don't go head to head with him your not going a wind going to head to head with your boss there your boss they have rank on you if they're eagle many a torrent use that rank if there's some one that you don't respect you gotta build a relationship with them if there's someone lessned regardless of the situation of the solution is the same build the relationship of trust help them build them up take a back seat let them get credit it's all those things and won't you do that you're goin to have you can have much better results than if you trying bang heads with them over come them defeat damn having antagonistic relationship of them as never going to work so play the game you've been lifting heavy weights for many years indeed sir now that you are in your mid forties are you still seeing gains in strength and muscle well yes i am and as a matter of fact i think one of the key a ganimedes of this is only a couple of years ago i set my my personal all time record for popshopper's ago day may be your two ago isoldi you do sixty three yet so ah but that being set oblio you know yer goin to go up and down so soon any don't you can't continuelly set records on a daily basis so was so wowin what's driving me so what i do is i'm constantly kind of going from gold to go to go and i get on a path where i'm trying to do something olgiati i'll read an article or all see something and i'll go that looks cool red ot looks hard that looks like a challenge or i don't think i could do that but i'm on a dry rot you know so i'll say okay you know what man i haven't dad left every toilette get onto get my get my five hundred pound that left on and so all i start focus and on the dead left and that the upaloft every day but i'm i'm dead to start to go heavy i am really working it i'm starting to all my you know oh maybe i'll be get lifting a little more off than i'll throw in another day and i'll leave you'll stop a little bit of that sprinting or a little bit of that to high raptured i distort you know spend more time deedling and after a while you know maybe a month goes by month and a half and i get where i want to be now as oi get to it looks gatine it my five hundred a left feeling good now i could say you know what i want to give five twenty five grit i could say that if but if you think about what i'm going to have to do in anybody that lifts weightily nos that the different it the higher you go the the horrors to increase a little bit more and and really would what he getting out of that yaklike in the real world big picture would be getting out of an extra you got five hundred pounds you can delaford you get down on eaten five pounds if the answer is the answers not a lot you know the answer is he no one will ever know the difference between you a five hundred pound deliver you and five twenty or ye forty five no one's going to know that difference when they roll with you when they look at you the knocking will have to sacrifice other parts of your physic ality in order to get there you're goin to be slower it roping in your pay me have your son to be able to do less talten it work out or less less repetition to calisthenes so i'll get there and then once i get to like that good gold on looking for than all just shift to another go why i'll start looking at something else and you know whatever it's going to be a a a certain number of you know what twenty raps squat routine at a certain weight of start heading towards that or a certain number of muscle usance certain overtower are you case may be i'll do that and that's anointing for for many many years and i never go so far down one path and become so specific that it takes away a bunch from the other areas because at the end of the day you know i want to be a while round it yet think that's that's a mature alas that the mature pursuit right there because one you're young you want to i mean that you like every one but i am to saint pretty general pretty typical that when you're young you want to get he set these now on a bench the onsociable bent she and you go or or the dead literal if you get five hundred when you're younger you want to get that twenty five twenty five you you want to get that by thirty five you don't get the five ovidum and you don't really see the big picture you don't see that that not only yet you you're going to have to send so much effort just to it that little game with it owns going to be be to toneless you're in a competition on something i got of their friend but not only are you saying how much i am your avoiding time you could be spending developing other aspects of your fitness if you're talking and working out so i i fell into the sin ye fell into the same thing about the year ago when i was never retentive conditioning in the gym you know like muscular conditioning and metabolic condition never into that tom but once you do that you find that danger so many games i can achieve doing this type of stuff when you know you i achieved be games when i was young lifting weights and getting this big bencerrages or whatever but in when you talk about like your physical body and fitness and stuff em gains in strength and muscle their almost endless ways ye can develop strength and muscle or physical edition in you mean physically asking as a whole yet so i strand and strengthens a man i know strength is defined but really when you kanata about strength that's like a that's a general term like you can even say his distance running is strong like he is a strong narrating or whatever it roturiere yes but i will just say his game strong the ossements yea and good or in a bad eversleigh but either way games it just in general you know um and the more elements of physicality you have developed the the better of your going to be absolutely so yet you you if you the lathams went when they talk about games in strength in muscle that means the numbers yet by hundred and am getting fine you know a byword miles and my steel getting again in strength muscle but they saw many other games to get in all kinds of differences aquacities or an like i said that's the mature weight of pursue it is to pursue all his things and set a cool gold and when the diminishing returns start to come about then you deshepoitn and then at the end of the day you're going to nutted but the big picture what you're going to end up with is this fully developed physicality that applies to pay more things in life than they would if you're just trying to get that bancoote dead lift up so yet your mayor your pursued that the histhory i opening thing i think i fell into it but the the way you put it i think that's very important especially when you start to get older you know when functioning over all you are totantis is not something that i just started to when i older when we were young in the sets we would do this we like a right will get it to better other once we were recent three hare all right we're going to go and we'd be doing things like hey we're going to do this espionage i an we get that we say oh we'll gonado fifty poles an that we get to that is we've been on this wife ye ni think that the i'm sure this allottee that actually conduct themselves like that you like i know to fairest kind of does that it just even more so than just an exercise just in a lotten you know he'll do that he'll set a goal foeren it or um and the ishii and in due something else and there's guys who bad kind o devote their life as almost like a hobby but just a part of their life will tell every year they'll take on something new methera a madley guitar just this whole year and then next something out sorter yet and more so than i i i'm not necessarily saying that i think it comes with age i'm just saying not so much sure way to to to get ganoatohale the as yet very swanson next question okay you talk about people becoming aware as leader when did you become aware as leader i fink of actually told this story before but he it was bricourt clear memory to me i was doing i was a young seal probably in my first or second was actual my second poltoon and we are taking down on oil rag and oil rigaer complicated there's a lot of there's different of levels to the oil rags and there you can see through all the levels because the floors are as made of a great space ically as a can see multiple defcription three hundred sixty degrees and there's all kinds of gear and in equipment all over the the different levels so i can pretty complicated anyways we came up on this level omination we got fifteen or twenty ties and we come up one of this level and everyone's everyone's spreads out in a line and were looking at the level on there's all kinds of complex stuff in front of us and which in the clear it you know you're looking for badgy's whatever i in this is just training and as we're looking at it every one kind of freezes cause there's so much complexity out there that every one just can a free us and just leave with his ical lay out jispies waisters confusing and it looked you know confusing me and complex and it so as i stood there every one frosine one froze i i basically came off line and put my gun to high port and i said hold left move right so as i was able to step back look around a cessation for the situation and once i assess a situation i just called out what to do i said hold left moved right respected the guys on the left stewart the guys in the right were going to move and and do the clearance and the guys did it he made i realize right then you know like while i i can i can kind of i think i do i think it letitia it wasn't then i didn't olassen take charge very things in this you will pinch you can't just as a new guy step off and start taking charge of you you'll get put your place but i i had that vision and the vision that i actually had was that patient of detachment the vision of coming off line and stepping out of the tax go situation and realizing that when you step back you can see everything and that was like a miracle to me and once i realized that it was always easy for me to do that from then on and novoy that but it it became easy for me to do that in regular life you know the things that i'm doing in having conversations in dealing with relationships and making sure marketing drag down into these crazy relationships situations or it business situations were in want of a motion going on and say you know what i descendimus that back in and observed this from a better vantage point that's more unbiased expression what if you don't have a good mentor so we talk about men tercianas ip is important in its good to have mentres in or what agree it's good to have mentors if you can find them in you can always find them and so any this individual that as his question what if you don't have a good mentor what do you do in for me actually brings back my memories of when i first got to the selfish when i first got to the sea teams it was actually pretty hard to find a good man or that i looked at him said you know i want to be like that person and that they were going to invest in you so it was one thing to say he lak i looks like a bad as i want to be like them that was easy but to have some one that says hey listen you guy i am going to invest in you and in you know make you into a great deal that that really wasn't happened is um i we had first of all the reason i some of reason to wasn't happen with cause it was guy's that were you are consequent on the pointment answer o wasn't like someone would grab you and pull you aside and uwen you got a seal fortunatae a little bit easier and you usually find somebody that's going to least take some interest in you but the like the vietnam guise they were around but they were you know instructors and or working in the training to partment so they didn't yorkese that on a daily basis they working to men to you they were going to be there for you and i i'll tell you not only that but the guys that i went through training with and and the guise that i ended up going to my first team with we we actually wanted to be more hard to care then what we saw nine we actually wanted to take it to another level and so to be honest with you we kind o meant or ourselves and we set the standard of what we thought a seal was supposed to be like in our minds and we started to act upon it i mean i i remember we were doing the the wrongs and the swims at the sultan with our fuller was alike the guise at the team would be wearinesse ers and a perishers and we be wearing boots in a ruck sack in the teudelingua like we were kinda crazy you know but that was as kind a mentoring ourselves in and we did that every thing you know we were spending time at the team on the weekend we would inspect each other's gear over n over again and modified it make sure it squared away and we were conflygrytion different things i remember trying to teach each other about the different radios that they had and different kind of knots and we had learned and so we we were always just kind of mentoresses and so i think you don't that's that's the point is that if you can't find a good mentor then you got become your own and i think with wit the way that world is now it's actually relatively easy to do that i mean first of all you can you can research what you want to be like you can figure out who you want to be like or maybe sophy want to be like but what as back of other humans you can take and bring on board now that is something i did all kinds of seal thorhall kinds of bad as feels that i said back guy's really good at this and i'm going to try and get good at that too will away that guy action the situation is all some atom going to try act that way too so it wasn't like i was trying to be like them but i was at least trying to emulate the best aspects of these different individuals and i think there is a lot of examples out there to day where you can do that you can look for people that emulate you can i mean you to be can basically find out how to do anything oh in facing you be careful that your that you sandriches some of the people that you look into on on that but i think the key really to mentor in yourself i goes back to what we just talked about with detachment because you need to if you want a mentor yourself you've got to be able to look yourself and you got to be able to look yourself in an honest way and that means you need to be a wood detach yourself and other serve yourself from that distant place by distant i mean three feet i mean just from just outside of inside your own brain and if you detach you concert your makita es and you can see what the long range you that your striving for you can see what it's contact get there and i think that this detonates what i've done when i haven't had a mentor is i've figured out a way to men or myself and i think the gods are too sad and the path that you draw out and you detach yourself so you can give yourself an honest observation of who you are and how you're doing and i think that is a good way to handle it but see i am it will be one more friendless question ah any thoughts on how to crank up the discipline and um where does discipline even come from where does discipline come from just a classic cuestion and whoever asked that question i would say thank you for asking a question where does discipline come from and any answers actually pretty simple and pretty obvious discipline comes from within it's an internal force now sure of a horse you can have discipline and posed on you by some person like like a drill instructor or like that feel good wants but the reality is that type of discipline isn't the real type of discipline that was hacking about that this plan is in a strong it won't survive that imposed discipline that some one else is putting on you what you're looking for and what your talking about and what you need is self disciplined ousel discipline as the very charm implies comes from the self it comes from you it comes from when you make a decision to be disciplined when you make a decision to be better when you make a decision to do more and to be more self discipline comes when you decided that you can to make a mark on the world at any of you think that you're not bation for you can't be disappointed it's because you haven't yet decided to be disappointed it's because you haven't coated that disappoint yet because you haven't become that discipline yet so where is discipline come from it comes from you so make the decision make the commitment become the discipline the discipline the root oldy that will improve every aspect of your life and i will make you better and stronger and smarter and faster and healthier and most importantly it'll make you free and that's pretty much all i've got for to night and if you want to continue
