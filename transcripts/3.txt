this is jacopo asked number three with echo charles and me jacka willin so last so we dug into the book about face by colonel david haworth and to day we're going to dive in to aid another book on that was very influential to me and it's called the last hundred yards now this book is very different from about face in many ways in number one it's it was not a new york times best seller it was probably never on any kind of list of any kind is a legit tactical guide book for people in the military that's one it is and am in a tall little bit about author right now gi name h j pool who retired from the marine corps and nineteen ninety three when he was on active duty he studied small unit tactics for nine years six months at the basic school and canamucan co seven months as a potenciana in vietnam three months as a rifle company commander a camp pennelton in nineteen fifty seven five months as a reniant headquarters come companied commander in vietnam and manini eight eight months as a rifle company commander and vietnam nineteen sixty eight nineteen sixty nine five and a half years in instructor with vance in pattering down a camp camp line while he was at that advanced in paterini company he developed taut and refined courses of instruction on the neverfail land navigation fire support coordination call for fire a just fire closer support two or three dinadan or movement to contact daylight attack night attacking filtration offence offensive military operations in urban terrain defensive military operations in urban corene and beseen and leadership so the guy has some good background and this book was very influential to me when i was coming up in again as i just like with about face as i was thinking about when i was going to say about it and i wanted to talk about when i got it and i couldn't remember when i got about face i just kind of came into my life as some point anthem thing with the last hundred yards and i don't really know a hundred per cent when i got it or who told me to get it it's one of those things that just became so ingrained with me that now i idiotte member when it happened so one of the one of the key kind of components or or the faces of the book that i can ahade to introduce you to is it it talks about something called manoeuvre warfare and whenever war fare is a is a obviously a type of warfare to type a technique and its its counter to something that's called la trition warfare now you could probably guess what a trition warfares a trition warfare is where do i go get the enemy where he is stand to ate and were the puncheh other in the face until one of us goes down now will you add bombs and bullets into that snare immense stand across from each other from the enemy and were going to shoot each other and bombah other until one of us breaks and that's very american way of fighting is to start this attrition warfare because why we've got massive supplies we've got of em industry and we an get away with that maneuver warfare is is very different and to go into the book a little bit in talking about maneuverer this is what we never warfare is in maneuverer the emphasis is on manoeuvre fire power is considered important only to the extent that it facilitates maneuver the overall offensive mission is to win decisively by getting the enemy disarrange so it's very different you in in that definition a iemon to kill the purse the enemy nor looking to make some surrender because it's in some ways easier if the enemy surrenders not to kill them all now to go on the folk is is outward on the emilian sis this is maneuverer that focus is outward on the enemy and a few mistakes like out distancing ones logistical support or shooting at a friendly unit or acceptable and unavoidable so that's kind of crazy right that you actually you take these risks in maneuverer where you might engage friendly forces he might get so separated that you end up in a bad situation but it's because your pushing the pace control is decentralized and every subeunt or individual is encouraged to display the initiative needed to react successfully to the local threat and this is the biggest distinguish between a tration warfare in the way it's run and maneuverer decentralized command and that is a chapter in the book extreme ownership that lay on a route it's atone of the laws of combat that we talk about is decentralized command he is that everybody that's out on the battle field every individual unit leader can make decisions on their own and they can make something happen it can react in the can execute without having a runnin up the chain of command that's maneuverer very very different and yevay where we see the big difference know you see a big bureaucratic company you now that we're working with business as we see a big girl birocrats company may become very centralized in their control and they fight attrition warfare against other companies because their bigger an they have more resources where as you see the young startups what are they doing there doing maneuverer there they've got decentralized command they've got people taking chances their taking risks and they've got different up leaders out don the balefire trying to make things happen the emphasis is on training personal nisaba to the book the empties on training personal well enough to head a time that they can follow their commanders and ten in combat after only receiving broad guidance of course sub unit must still keep their commanders and form of any actions that might affect edition units so you end up with a situation where the commander is not telling you exactly what to do there give you broad guidance a this is the tistance the mission i want to have accomplished and you're not telling you exactly have complish it thir just tell you want what they want done so that's a that's that's a difference between the two now there's a piece that's very different as well or maybe not different but another key element of manoeuverer and decentralized command verses attrition warfare and centralized command so if you don't e if you listening you haven't been the military before the military is separated into two groups of people officers and enlisted people the officers are sort of the senior leaders who are you know strategic planners and their their there the broader higher up higher ranking leaders and in the enlisted are the tacticians the folks that are shooting the machine guns throw on their grenades making things happen and they do have you know that the endless did service men also have their non commissioned officers which are the senior ranking in listed guise which are usually the expert tactitians but it's interesting so this is going back to the book now in in the average polton the end ceos provide most of the collective experience so again you see the sometimes in the movies where they get the young officer and their green and they don't rely know what's going on and then you get the salty old you know bad ass that's played by a salted youket wood and easy that old regait all the experience that's what that saying this the andies provided most of the collective experience for this reason they should participate in most of the tactical decisions that absolutely make sense this should in no weight shallingford y of the officers okay that's that sensible after all commissioned and non commissioned officers shared the same responsibilities in combat if elite which is the officer is wounded the potumagan takes over when they both this is key when they both work together better decisions result obviously he got two minds and instead of one this brain trust can be further enhanced by including squalders so there there said let's bring in more minds more of these junior in listengese let's find out what they think the enduring satisfaction that comes from making the situation ly correct decision and then having that decision fully supported during execution far out was the temporary insecurity that may come from so soliciting the advice of support ments i love that cot a love that became sad again so it saying that the decision and the execution doing out well far out was the temporary insecurity that may come from soliciting the advice of subordinates so and i used to see this with these young junior officers a there insecure with their leadership they don't want to take advice and they definitely don't want to ask for advice because they feel like that makes him look weak and reorient her talking about you i don't know what they're talking about foddering a lose respect for it that's all their ego talking and is there in security talking whereas you get a young officer that smart and that's confidence his no problem looking at the gunnery sergeant looking at a platoon chief and saying hay chief how do you think we should do this hey chief i've never even seen this type of operation for can you give me some help or kin let can you take lead ones in that is the way a real leader operates you don't always see that unfortunately thing with them the stakes to right when you so all manomet mistake oh exalts hard to do that a lot of the time because he think all is god to know what is doing you obviously in mistake he even admitted a canting you and i i what what the reality is people don't actually think that they don't think o ye just admitted his mistake he really doesn't know he is now no okay well least he's aware of his mistake unless everything they do is a magnate in the de on the other hand it is courting disaster to rely on one's personal impressions to provide the solution to complex inari and i not consider whether one supportasses to execute that solution so don't sit there stuck in your own brain afraid to ask anybody else or you're going to lose now as we pushed through this we can get pretty deep um to you at this going back the book again pptousai man actively engaged in a losing effort this shortage of rest reference material can be quite unsettling and what this what this is talking about previously this sentence is seeing that although there's all kinds of books and manuals in the military this bald reference material of exactly how to do the front line one is that point man do what is that machine gun or duke how do they actually do it that information being get lost because it's more pass word a mouth than anything else in it goes into a talking about the believe it or not haworth with a combat commission from corea boutecon david haworth was no stranger to war we called this when he was called to serve in vietnam after two tours he pointed out that the u s knowledge on small unit in patriotic had not been significantly enhanced by the longest warn us history meaning vietnam and here's what here's what hack work said almost fifteen years since the tragic inevitable fall side gown and this is so saying this fifteen years after the end of inamoratos fifteen years since the end since the tragic and evil fall agone there has been no major honest post mortem of the war there have been coteing with the big picture but none has a dress the lessons learned the hard way at the fighting level where people died and the war was in fact lost so all those lessons learned in all those no one ever made an honest critique and dug down on the botfield to see what these guys code and i know i talked about this last time as well is that when i first got the seal teams there was guy from vietnam and when those guys spoke he absolutely listened because you were hearing now let now let and that if i didn't experience that if i didn't meet those guys i will no one yet now i would hurt it it wasn't written down anywhere and so you've got always remember when you do learn stuff you got a right it down and you know layfolk about that the fact that when we got back from the body you are started teaching it trade it was called training to tachment and he started teaching the the seals that were coming out of a line guys at a coming out of the seal training and that's where we were had the opportunity to really capture one and information that we learned in remote and we all the pass it on in ultimately those lessons learned or what became the book so that being sad you start talking about doctrine and i can tell you that doctrine is not everything in fact and you here talk about people people's biggest rents are often the biggest weaknesses or if you have some one that superesse than there their agressiveness world are making things appen and that a real advantage for him but they can get over aggressive in the band up to in stupid things and they fail that's an example of how your biggest strength can be our biggest weaknesses in in the felines we really didn't have we had very limited doctrine and it was a real big weakness for us because if you had never run a certain type of operation before you couldn't refer back to something and say okay here's the method are the written documentation of how your sposo do it and such that's pretty weak that's pretty horrible it's a big weakness but at the same time it was a strength because as the battle field changed as we started getting cast with missions that we had never done before that no one had ever done before we were very adaptable because we were used to try to figure things out so it a strength in weakness that being said and although we did capture much of our lessons learned this is going back to the book here basic field manual tarkill these manuals that capture the doctrine knowledge is fine but it is useless without common sense common sense is of greater value than all the words in the book and this is another thing they will stare you typically put in hollywood movies about coperate soldiers other you've got some guy that's by the book by the book by the boy and and you can see it is his calling in out missis this is come all armories agitates in a brink corn on galinee said that common sense was more important than anything in that in the field manes which is some i completely agree with and to to carry that point a little bit further back the book in her a quote from major general fuller the central ideas of an army is known as its doctrine which to be sound must be based on principles of war and which to be effective must be elastic enough to admit of mutation in accordance with change in circumstance so again these all these people that really understand war they know that this doctrine is something that needs to be written at ease to exist but it needs to be adapted to and common sense is the superior rank over doctrine in another thing and this is this is a a a comment on training because it becomes very difficult when you think about training people for situations that are unknown it's easy to train something people for something that they know is going to happen but it's a lot more difficult to train people for something that one know how do you do that as we get into the discussion of training a little bit the small unit into the book here the small bed it that to faithfully follows the massed in the book will eventually attempt it under the wrong conditions further more the unit may have a different have difficulty surprising any enemy who is read their book not make sense right that enemies going a know your play and by the way all these military manuals general be found all mine there there arminteros the internet so the enemy definitely reads what we have on the other hand the unit that doesn't prepare for any particular snare will take two long to decide what to do automatically sacrificing surprised in momentum and then not have the team work to execute what it does decide to do so there's two ends of the spectrum you know we talk about the dionysia and how your constantly going in opposing forces will hear syou know you can train so horrid and so specifically to what you doctrine that it eliminate your flexibility the other end of the spectrum is to not trade at all and then you can execute anything and romero mell said the ordinary soldier has a surprisingly good nose for one is true and what is false and an i that's not just soldiers he i i talked about that before that people know even if it oopathi they know you're not telling them that they might not know what the actual truth is and and then going back to training the actuality aunt bacteria back to book an actuality mots most small scale combat is wonder lost months before the battle during training and that something that people say all with omittere larges left you know it's during that training as you prepare that's what wins the battle the fight camp a same thing with a with military maneuvers so as we continue on here as expected battle field conditions change so too must learning over a liance on books lotions in itself constitute a short fallen training because it minimizes the importance of the unique aspects of each situation blind faith and standard operating procedure doesn't even constitute being well trained this is something that when i was running training we calls complete mayhem on the guise that were going through training and anybody that went through training when i was running it right now as a smile on her face because they know that they were put into scenarios that were completely confusing distracting disturbing mayhem coselli praise and reason we did that is because we wanted to cast their minds not their standard operating procedure not ah there shooting capabilities with wonted test the minds of the leaders could the leaders be in that chaos step back from that chaos either physically or mentally or both get in assessment of everything that was happening and then say okay this is what we need to do to get out of the situation or improve the situation a wind the situation what the the other thing that it requires not only as at the leader step back and have the abilitie ention these non commission officers must love initiative and must hold walk round they have to the utmost it often happens that a sergeant or even a crop caporal made a side a battle by boldness with which he seizes the bitter ground and holds it so we tried to inspire the younger guys the new guys aguhao experience in the silkiest we wanted that guy to go you know an amangis room on the take this builder only get to the root up on to get the good position and not to do it as a row let but wavin the confines of what the strategy was in what the plan was and in that where you end up with a with unitatis together very well in a one of the things that i remember of where people get locked into these events sometimes nemiah you'll see a fighter that's got a good you know ground game or he and any all he's trying to do is take the person down take the person down use nadering tis keep trying to clinch keekee shooting shots and they're getting their shot stuff but they can't adapt the don't have the skills for they're the mind set to adopt or remember one enaries what's called a bunkered machine gun fishiness an a training a training of vent so there's a long hallway this is an unurban environment there's a big giant building the all face by the way but there's a big giant building and he in the end of the hallway we've got a bad guy whose inboard positions to easiness and drawers and concrete and he's got a fully automatic pantallon and the seals are trying to go down the hallway to get up and there shoot at him but this guy's in a bunker position they can't hit him he's hidden and so every time they come out the hallway to try and move towards him he just mowsannas is one guy that it's another guy then three guys that six guys finite guys or lanina gilcase every time they got shot with papal if they get shot a few times were putting them down like okayed just laid down stayed there your dead stay there you're dead i'll gay your oak you antouhonoran got a latoners i go to the guide at running and it was a petunia and i walked over i said ghou know houses going to work out he said it we jes got up i got a fifty guys moving down the hallway and i said you think there might be another way the kind of looked at me and he realized that a there's another way he said a couple guys back out of the building they walked the down the outside the building to the window where the guy was bunker din threw a couple of grenades in there jumped in killed a guy but the mind set wasn't there to have the flexibility to do that and that's what we are training cause i never want to see guys get locked in to a situation that's why training all training needs to expand your brain and you too expand your mining to oenotrian should constrain your ideas yet aliens like that would be a different type of training even in like you could like a foorteeneth double leg or something there for in their not getting it then not getting it he should have been trained in other take down if in fact taking the guide down was a strategy he should be trained in other stuff jasome judo stuff on don't know doubt about it and this is what one thing is interesting is i think it dette evolution is your hair you know about connomore right now and i hate to jump on the bandwagon but you know you see him doing like this loveletters which is billy good because what is that doing that training you for these weird situations you know and that's another in like with a training to gittith jeff glover he puts himself in these weird positions and does these crazy things that when it happens to him he just has better reaction because he's used to being in these strange positions if and when we work with corporations um and work with companies will will do roland with these sos or middle of a managers and will will play you know layfield play the unruly old you know a job sight for men that knows more than you do and how you goin to do with em and we put him inisfail situations and do things and say things and that that throw them for a look that made him uncomfortable that that they don't know the solution to that to think on their feet and that's that's what one of them you know one of the pieces of training that i was like to go back to his how can we how can we do things that surprise people in draining so that so that we exercise the brain of not what they know we don't we got to get what you know we got a train which you know you got procity how do we train what you don't know when don't expect yet i go deeper is like almost like a level deeper in the training laetitia beneficial i think i think energies talk about this training to get through the a good way to train for self defense is train with the real aleta du whose white belt so you won't do predictable thing but eve been training every day it'll do unpredictable things where you you know won't be supream and at the same time he won't be something that you have full knowledge of inflorentia if you get the two hundred and eighty pound power house that shows up the gym that's never trained before the first time you train with him it's going to be harder to catch him then it will three months later no maybe maybe three months it'll be about the same but like a monk into it where he kindes what he posed to try and do her any but you know what exactly redenta do then is easy to catch him easier so you've you're you're right it definitely as a is a transitional time in it is good to trenwith people you have no idea what they're going to do yet and it's not even to say that that then he did give you experience with these unorthodox thing for sure but that's not where you're talking about for it was a being trained with being trained is not to be so dogmatic in your actions and your in over your plan is to this this un's really cliche it take spect the unexpected right foot trains you to think that way well it's true and i don't know if this is clear not i'm pretty sure it is but i say this and people kind of freak out when i say it because i'm like but ah a structure discipline person but i say on time for you my you know and you got a free your mind that's what the when i talk about this stuff i i hate when i find myself in a situation where my mind is not free to see what's going on and i can't detach from what's not ye in and go and enter the unknown in an and deal with the unknown y you know another thing that he can affect this is art ego and how hard ego can prevent us from learning or listening to other people or other schools or other martial arts or other gems or other perspectives eso i in this book the last hundred yards etogo that ah even giving a sister organization with the same manuel's credit for knowing anything can be difficult pride in one's unit can help to build cohesion but can also stand in the way of learning learning must always take priority over pride how readily how readily a military or nizain can assimilate nonoma establishes how easily its component elements can acquire new knowledge the germans of world war won are generally credited with the veloping the application parameters that the fine modern impetrata here's how they did it the german army of nineteen fourteen was the most decentralized in europe free from all but the most general supervision and relieved by a promotion system that based based strictly on senorita of the need to constantly please superiors the german battalion or company commander was free to train his troops according to his own lights so they waited vance people was desolata it based on how well you did on this particular thing so they weren't kissing asked the whole time we just oh you are rank you now you get promoted so they were free to cooperate and do the best they could in that had a big and big in packed for for example by nineteen eighteen the germans had line in patrisque that could penetrate allied defence lines almost at will as opposed to you know the the allies who would always try incarnates big giant mass of attack at the same time and you after did every one alienate execute perfectly with thousands of people that's obviously very challenging rather than just an oke or goal is to break through the lines don't figure it out think of all the different creative ways that go to figure that out in its agitate and that's why it was so successful now the germans lost they obviously made some mistakes on the strategic level and as a matter national policy they made some pretty big mistakes so but that's kind of a haskin of a whole nother one a story most military leaders agree that doing nothing to prepare an infanticide combat also does little to enhance its chances for success most can also agreed that providing guidance that is too restrictive may cause the squad disregard unforeseen circumstances the answer i must lie somewhere between that's what we've been talking about it in he see this with fighters as well as fighters that prepare for a specific attack from somebody in but in that other somebody decides to mix it up and comes out and does something to sotavento me when i was cornfide before rougon out said oh i didn't expect that man he egotistic just took you don john bones just took down a a d c you know what were back come from red i did he do that so i see that kind of that that mentality that throw things often put before in a perdicament yet and you mention john jones he on he accendit that some of the stuff that he does he disease never trained for he might it it it's man is that different that separate element of your mind or the pertaining on enough yet draining doing that is just a creed of person or whatever um just that separate element it's it's a whole different part of the strategy you know the allamater asked it ye and also you can see that he encouraged by greaton he encouraged and he does things you know he he has an open mind red got a free mind and a host long way for your mind that is kind of a place by the way there is the soul is free or mine on the restitution but something else will fall out another word a ourisia with that free let's not say ah so fine to talk about decentralized command and and what i would see appeal decentralised command as i tell some junior leader canoe central is mantelet your ciclaton do with any due and they go out on a battle field and that this is a yogin and training when there no one's goin to die they go and all the little leaders would get their own idea and they go and try make all the stuff and happen and the command to his muse control and everyone would get rush didn't shot up with paint ball moinard and they come back and it roared you such was prettier so and i would say no you did decentralized command but you missed the key part of the centralized command which is guidance parameters understanding of the mission pomanders intent standard operating procedure limits of advance all these nice little rich strictions that you put on the guise now there there wide restrictions i shouldn't a little their wide researches they give them a lot of mobility but they understand what the objective is what be and state is what their parameters are how far they can never like they can know that can pay you to call pass his building you can't capaches road you can't go wherever you draw those lines so that they can operate freely within those lines and that's how they're made at a you maintain control with the centralized command are would you call like guide lines or susey say operate within those lines is it pretty encouraged to stay within those lines with their creativity or disecrating is that allowed to kinda overfloat like if you say you know how far you can engage there are you saying or there are no exceptions no your aviemore i call you up and say echo a abuilding fourteen right now with the enemy moving to building twenty seven i want to push down this road or weak or to do that and as you say i lecheim at when we check larater forces it yet where you got to go you can move so there are times were at the check back with you to make sure we're good to go and make sure that you understand but i'm i'm going beyond what parameters were set and that's why after can you can you but i went all the way up to that point i m a never on the battle field for you don three four five six hours maybe it was a day maybe it was two days without having to say ah i need em guidance as long in a fishbone what he told me yes these guidelines are kind o ye go in with the knowledge that there are exceptions as long as the responsible yes so as long as what you do it you be reponsible about making those except an and communicate renovated things happen when that neames when you go outside them the limitations i your supposed to be in hand you don't tell me but the ontary very ropematch now um when we when we talk about why it's so why you have to maintain that flexibility the reason is because combat is infinitely complex and it's one of those i conomise the asistente but it's infinitely complex and believe me the complexity of the got me got the best of me on many occasions where i was where i lost it i did not could not fall the complexes tuition i had to that things happened i had to regret it the train figure mouth and assemble his thoughts in my head as all this thing it altisonans go into the book as it relates to combat the term situation and compasses many variables mission and emita weather troops and fire support time space legists each category has many faces disregarding a seemingly inconsequential sort of circumstance can invalidate an otherwise logical solution one must continually study possibilities continually studied possibilities and i've seen that where one little problem can escalate into all kinds epopeia something that whether it's a unit that we date did just we just talk about which is you unitiate want supposed to be in the tenby that can become very problematic as you can imagine cause all of a sudden you know you've got people shooting from a building where there's not supposed to be friendly as of thaswot you're goin to see back at ray so that's a a horrible situation things with communication where you know some radio frequencies go down or for for whatever reason you lose communications with people and all the sudden you're on a black hole and you don't know what's happening that's another situation where one little tiny peace can really throw massive complexities into the situation going back to rome and back to training the best form of welfare for the troops is first class training this saves unnecessary casualties and i think i did docuere partake carrier people you know and how taking care your people eight can mean at a measured cut a loose early because at me you take care of him i reality is the way you take care of him is to train a orthaeus i will never lose sight of that one this is a skipping around a little bit but i want to throw this in there because because the fight we added remade and it's just talking about how the fighting in the urban environment he is so challenging and it says in the book built up areas meaning cities should be by past wherever possible in urban terrain the attacker may need as much as a ten to one man power advantage and son ze wrote the art of war the worst policy is to attack cities and if troops are attacking cities their strength will be exhausted that just a for time a mortal trying to fight in cities is absolutely the most challenging of all environments why contherth dug in and their thin of their little strategy kind is established their dug an they they are three hundred and six feet degrees around you i they are above you they are to left to the right in front of you there behind you and her beneath you there in the seed systems there in the basements so you're in this tree hundred sixty degree fire zone and on top of that just about every building is a hardened fighting position aright he so so all you have to do is enameling and you've got a pill box you've got it you've got a bunker in so therefore it's very very jaunting and i just talked about having a enemy machine gun a bunkered fighting position that's a nightmare it's a little less of a night mare when you have cakes to comedias now sir so god bless the tankers i love those guys were worked side by side with those guys on one a d guy's crushed it for us and we preciated it respect for one and one's enemy is crucial to success on the battle field he is not a coward he is not stupid and he probably has comparable weaponry that's from the book how to focus on the enemy and make sure that you are you are respecting the enemy flexibility to a changing situation again in the book having debilitate and in react which changing situation can have great value in war what manuals contain is mostly technique not doctrine this technique is merely a frame work around which to build common sense solutions and what that translates to you is disappoint freedom you have these standard perintheus you work them you refine them you practise them you get good at them but you don't get stuck with them you free your mind by having disciplined and it means that you can adopt these shrikanta operating procedures you can adapt them instantaneously and do something else with them because you're a my stroke and you can make that happen now we get into this in this is going a little bit deep but we start talking about something called mission type orders and that is different from let's say what would be called a directive where i say echo you're going to move down this street you're goin to take this building number twenty seven you're goin to set security in there and you're going to hold that position that's different because now i've told you applewaite you have set up after you can move down the street some telling you which way are going to go and then i tell you act which building here to take down and i italiener in there now what i really want to say is that that means you have to do what i just told you i cause you have no choice i i mean an give you any other options i told you exactly what to do now and if i were to say acco we think the enemies over in this area we want to be able to hold security on them from an elevated position find a building down there make that happen mum so now you've how kind of freedom you might pick twenty seven cause maybe it was the best building but may be thirty six was maybe thirty two was maybe twenty seven was hardened may be wasn't pollenous but you have this organic flexibility in your mind because you've been given a goal of why you're doing the mission he not just what to do so very important when you're deal with people you know in any walk life that you call him not just what they're trying to do what to do but what there trying to accomplish what the mission is why they are doing it and that is incredibly important just like aggressiveness is important in going back to the book from a general howling mad smith since i joined the marines i have advocated aggressiveness in the field and constant offense action it quickly he hard and keep right on hitting give the enemy no rest no opportunity to console and his forces and hypakoueis is the shortest road to victory do i need to even expand on that iaean i think how all mad smith just at the nail on the head next point controlling subordinate only to the extent that surprised moment menataries personal should become so familiar with their leader's intent that they can be trusted to act on their own unitive they should never be required to ask permission to respond to crises situation second counticide combat suonate must be trusted to act appropriately and recall me required to inform a leaders of decisions that might affect others that if that decentralized command now ye're goin to think at first that this is a little bit of a strebt it's not so controlled only the extent that surprised a moment onattached i'm going to relate that to juitler it or not in duet and in any sport you have to train your standard operating procedure so that your body can execute them without directives right if you have an instinct to defend the armor you will escape the onlocky do not have that instinct because you are trained enough you will get caught me or walk if you have to think about the move it is too late and that's exactly what decentralized command as if echoes out on the battle field and he gets flanked and he asked a ask me what to do he's going to get killed if echoes on the mat with me and i slap up comer on him and he asked to think about the defence it's too late he's already tapping whereas if i go for the cure and his instinct moves in out of that position then you survive the the ah one more thing that i when i think about that type of training the something we used to do was called blender drills would he take your seal squat or your seaton and you start making calls on him plank laughed you push right strong right sent her belly just do the most random calls so that men call a like you may be elhannon you got you got sixteen guys to called immediate action trullian for instance if you are a patrolling through the desert and you can start getting shot at from the front and then you do a what's called a contact drill you're going to react to that contact the contact is the enemy you're going to do a maneuver as a group and they're all kind of choriography manoeuvres were the swan one goes over here as quatuor here we laid on a base of fire start to move cover move out but what we would do as we would mix up those calls in the middle of one manoeuvre call for another alrina the middle of that one we'd call from other one in the middle that one we'd call from another one and what it did was a trained the mind he trained the minds of the leaders and of the guise to expect the unexpected as you said earlier in that cleat waveth something that's completely necessary trained them to be re active and open minded to things that were going to happen now when we talk about learning in this is a the title of this chapter in in the book the last hundred yards its called old habit may get in the way then i think it's pretty obvious what that means adults learn here is a dollanity the context of what they already know ideas that are too far removed from their personal frames of reference or hard for them to accept how often do we see that we see it in life we see the business world we see in combat we see in training ideas that are too far removed from people's personal frame of reference or hold for them to accept unfortunately when one gets dropped into a hot landing zone on its first day in combat is often too late for him to learn any more for this reason infantry must continually re assess and expand their frames of reference boom how eifer this reason infantry men and everybody else in the world must continually reassess and expand their frames of reference everybody when one arrival at stake the other way can hold as much appeal as the established way so clearly we see people in the business world stuck in that run all the time we see people in protecters nal lives they it stuck in a rut all the time so everybody has got a continually reassess in the span expand their frame of reference going back to boot what adults know comes primarily from two sources what they have been told and what they have experienced personally githa's pretty clear right having that's pretty obvious but this is when it gets pretty cool they sometimes have difficulty cheeping the two sense of ideas separated becoming convinced that what they have been told is true even though it even never personally experienced it and that is something that you see in the military you see the military where gissing of they hear something they make it into something that they think that they have experienced i know it sounds crazy but they do it and it's dangerous it's dangerous and i never when i realised that that happened when i realized that that was going on i was very suspect of everything that got said i you know i was very suspectin said well let's let make sure that we can form these ideas before we just run out and do him as that kind of like those martlemas arts demonstrations right exactly exactly you can imagine that the fore the us and before you actually putting two humans in a cage to brow it was all feredia it and if some one said you know what if you strike the person here in the neck they will fall down re and end this is the people legitimately believe that hay if you hit the person to act there's a great honor in a golden to soon so let a a and they will metely fall out and people believe happen an ever trying it but they believed it and there was the lot of the times those stories were mixed in with some one that had been told that they'd seen at one time or the leeper ced it or whatever and so that's a good point um and this is when you get into people that are not telling the whole story and this is something in very careful of his when i know something like by never claimed anointing a hundred per cent and i i will always call yet everything with you know like a ninety nine point nine per cent read but there is sometimes when i'm giving information and i'm saying look i this is not a hundred per cent i don't know this for sure but this is what i've seen in this is one of experience sometimes i'm like a lesson i know this and i have experienced it and this is what will work and i i definitely when i was instructing in the seatons i was very clear when i was saying hey i have not done that type of mission before or i have not done this in combat or have not to see how this will really work but here's what i think because that's a lot different than this is what you need to do as i have seen it i have done it and i do know confidently that barring the common sense this is rehoused execute that soon so sore back to the book stores have many reasons for not disclosing every facet of an issue one is to propound a more convincingly their perspective in pitmen can't afford to harbor points of view that aren't well founded they need continually to reassess their viewpoint and expanding of reference to incompassionate from a round the world and a cross centuries awsome your my is that kind of like um looking something up on gogoniant in then the difference between displaying with that first answer and going with the you know a bunch of unchristened website ye an ye me in and people that see something on the internet and then talk about it as if they know it first hand right when they read on their fur that first result they got they clicked on impulse yeats people out there we don't like you ter you clouding the truth okay getting into some leadership and really life joyces and you can apply these salive you can play the business um here is some choices that humans after make protect the status quo or take risks necessary to win decisively that that's that be on its own protecting the status quo can be easier than changing it to take action one risk make him mistake such a choice and it's not a black and white choices a lot o shade grey in there and how can you modulate that choice but it is a choice that you have to be aware of focus in words to prevent mistakes or on the enemy to keep pace with a changing situation this is an interesting professional professionals of all types try to minimize errors unfortunately trying to do trying too hard to do so in the military profession has a serious trade off a nitiate ability to surprise one adversary perspective on the over all picture and learning just a name of the and i sate those of exact same and any profession that when you when you are only focused on not making mistakes how you goin to make any rested you just crane the the minute that year just like i am to go with what i know and i am so guilty of this i am the guiltiest of all is in that ivery um set in my ways in in the move that i do you know i do for submission may be even too you know ah but you know there there like what i'm good at so i do the aloan i go through phases and is one sad faces i go through days where i take a lot of risks and i learn more and then i go through days where i'm just there because i have to train and i'm going to do what i do and what i'm goin to do it i do well but that's not when i learned that's not when i got better and i get better when i'm trying something do and that applies to everything in life cetonia try man's ability to react to whatever confronts him is is a forty to exercise some initiative you gotta give your people the freedom to manoeuver yeast in combat the leader must personally supervise only those actions that jeopardize the overall mission and then allow subbort exercise initiative and make a few mistakes on everything else those subordinates must be able to identify mistakes as they happen without fear of punishment or the same as examinin us making mistakes about fearfulsome you know what then or you know but demestre does these drills he called consequence free drills where he just says okay you're going to start you know that some one goin t be on your back and you're going to try to escape but doesn't matter doesn't matter what happens if they so at you doesn't matter just doesn't matter consequence free drills it's just to take chances because all of us you know we all hate getting to a toute all hate giving up position that so you do this coquetry jules you okay i look at guy in like i get your in a damnatory know so do i'm going to try crazy stuff and that's what they're saying here you got it to give people that chances to make mistakes yet and that's an accent important one because um how that applies elatha pastelike right when you're born when you're when you're but like if you etsaou parenting style if you have that painting style where it could make some mistake he still as milk he or he's trying something to make some mistake and he gets punished for it and that's how he's raised when he grows up he's going to be very reluctant to try new things in life and or or explore certain you know aspects of of creativity namely likestar ting his own business that i most people don't start their own business because they have lived that kind i think most of us have lived that kind of life where if you make a mistake when you're a kid you get punish for it even in school when you make a mistake on your test get that red as on the thing you got five root a tan you got a fifty prenoit ask there's your punishment your as only an i don't know these living can i learn all take the dust again and tell you that i know no you got a nap there is your punishment repeat the grade is so there's your bat so you don't even want to make any mistakes you don't want to try anything new you don't want to and you just have that mind sick and i let most epeita there is however a point where people get you could be raised in a way where you're not responsible for your own actions because there's no consequences to what you do so if you don't study and you get the red axes all over your test in the orosei any punishment for it but they are you will never learn katterle only he who suffers remembers right but there's a difference in you this a adolay's comes back to that economy that you talk about where it's it's really in the middle area so i think that it has to be leaning towards that what your thing let em give him freedom to operate if you make a mistake but there putting effort into it that should be commended don't if you get one wrong to wrong don't give him this trophy that says an congratulations you failed a failure should should be a in the gold right is to to make successful people i i will i will despite what i said or been in conjunction with what i said about bearleading to be consequences i agree that the correct answer of the collect reaction would not be you failed your horrible but you failed what did you learn ye can we improve it exactly exactly right so you notice that was exactly exactly hovel exactly right yes for sure so yet the kind o gettin the best of both worlds were they get get that that the fact that they failed they understand that and of course no one justling is to fail so they know that they failed the unsound that they failed but encouraged to improve and encouraged to understand but i can go in a lot of ways people don't get that he onneyatte you definitely don't see it when in businesses you definitely don't see it in the military um answer aderit got him courage that way an it and i think it it could get and just met speaking from zerefore but i would imagine that it would get really rigid in the military cause the stakes are or a lot higher well that's why this is talbot training ye and don't want to let people make those kind of mistakes and combat you won't give him that much rope when they can get somebody really old in a combat yeah when i yahia training in thin in life in a learning situation or a developing faverish in life really is your whole life not so always learning olliver so i think to stick to that oh for met whatever you an a call it stick to that where it understanding or mistake don't like i'm mistake a legitimate mistake the punishment should not be this significant part of that experience and learning she'll learning should be in a loriners different philosophy to nother i got rid there's got to be some consequence some people don't learn without contritely avoids with these some of the new generation which here you might even be part of other than the year of the new generation at rows of consequence for use and they don't take it your monsoor actions they don't take ownership right of anything that goes wrong because they have been raised in a way where failure doesn't matter and there is no consequences to their actions yes so absolutely to um not to beat a dead her horse on this subject i had some notes in her a round this from the book trying to hard to follow the book while saving battlefields such a watons makes one fairly predictable even to enemies who haven't read the book these don't easy after makes it changes and back to the book veston have to be drastically different from what's in the book often it's enough to every man of speed stealth or deception with which the standard method is executed standardizing what subordinates practice in peace time may make those subordinate easier to control but does not help them learn the alterniva technique needed to develop mention battle so that actually support your lastest andard sing said red as i want to board at practice and peace time may make to suborn an easier to control so you're trying to control some one by beating them down and sayin you fail dey do it this way and the only way you're going more control of them but you are going to not allow them to operating the real world with a to think of new ideas and thiotirih mienne you might i would hypothesis you might not even get the best out of him really i believe you are coemiterio standard of of output and that's kind of it and and going to a cloak from the book supporting your yeates's from colonel merit a eden he goes on about how he need to fight the japanese and he closes with an courage your individuals and bring them out which is just a a beautiful statement now this is this is kind of a close out this section here um we are talking about in this distaste applies to life human beings are always trying to structure the chaos of battle and that may be the root of the problem he man beings humanly into one half structure they want things to be orderly and combat is not orderly nor is life nor a relationships nor are business deal snuff nor is the chain of command nor are personalities in eagles and everything that we try and do to control this chaos the idea that we can control it is false newity have to do you have to deal with it bread yestereen squirearch you you have to let it move and see where its weaknesses aurangabadis what you can and let go of what you can't fenianism ye there kinda they're not rigid or nothing why we talk i on i'm training with some one that bigger one yet now you get on top you can't hold them down ruin after let them move underneath you yes yes and that's what this reminds me of ye i'll add this to your list of things that aren't controllable um all of existence the way like you think of a leaf or a you don't take onconsiderate something that's control like a that's why we invent ruler said i win van thermometers you know temperature so dynamic i can walk right five feet away the counter when you really come down to the tempting be different there's no set controlled anything everything so litigious and slippery and wearing everything everything all of existence the but but like how you said were people try to control the catinat's in erate though that's why i moitriers and mile markers and pits and any can drive you crazy if you try and control the chaos of combat you're goin to get destroyed and if you try and control every thing in your life things that are not controllable than you are going to destroy it you try and control the relationship you and aspects of relationship that are not couldn't throw labden's you control rations ip you control you yourself in a real ambiguous way by the way because you're always adapting ideally from an ideal standpoint year always adapting as well so yes yet i kind of langenmantl you trying control the relationship i could show you other person of wind readout control yourself at his most people don't do that most people don't exercise the beauty of mind control that they can control your mind you can think what you want to think you can put those thoughts in you a you can eliminate the bad ones and bring forth to good ones it mind control ye in i almost want to close on that cause that's such a good thing to remember but i will follow up with us it says complex instructions are at best premature during what is usually an inaccurate assessment this situation so when you looking at something you onager supplant hers organ a do at best that's premature and an accurate what your plan is so you trying to figure out what you're going to do with that business do you and your trances very detailed plan around it at best exprimitur accurate it at best it's premature accurate so don't get locked round economat these plans are going to be rigidities away we're going to do it at best it prematurely so think about what you can control what you can't and moveor forego example of recognizing or been wait a recognized if you're not practicing these types of the hot sir i was of looking at things is when you make a pin in the plant and it doesn't go according to plan and you get mad about it you're not to be a red black or roared side a there is a recollection and when you're relationship isn't going the way you wanted to be it's because you is you get news fish that you can't control and this other human being yet you can only control you so i don't and this goes back to we can about all my last shell when we talk about you know your family and your close friends and he do we on the got to the point where i think i was in he you can't bewritten than you said the same thing and i think this is a little bit more clarity on that point as you can not control them so you need to gravat you can you know keep it on keep it as under control as you can put your knock going to get the old control that you have think you i that you desire yes it's kind o like if you have this big like trash can lid and then you have this blow is like mercury your trying to keep it in the sinner but don't try to like squeezing with your hand or something of injuce out of your fingers now yes and and that what if your costosa comes up with examples like a trash can lividity you can't control but all you can do is lesson not your head and then to say good point more will isn't analogy and unlike this comparison of you now using to force chuck so moving on moving on to a questions and we've got from twitteration got some really good questions in an asante fact these our continual ation of questions and even ask the time because we in get through many of them from the last time i asked for imputation sinuation which means i apologize once again i i don't have the names collected of whom gave these questions so my fault i apologise if you weener your question we preciate you given us the question said weakens wer it first one is get down to it so in regard to judicio a common question but you are impletor no gie do you train both it's a a the answer is do and no gie i definitely trade both i like the trainband care which one there both fond me and just as we been talking about a lot to night to the book the last hundred yards i want my training to be different and surprising and be uncontrollable and when you change it definitely affects you you change from geanalogical your ginger sline the place you have to be a better grappleton the old deal with that so i want to be a better grapes like you that any nice there's something else it's in between geoghen's mepote mamalukes on and it is somewhere in between genoese you can get legitimate risk control it's hard to sneak in a choke on somebody when there were in close to theirs there is benefits to him all and i try do all ye what um do you find any benefit to doing one and or the other you know like if you treat in the getherer certain benefits and training with a geishan if if you trained with a gee you your gefecht be better because there's no friction and so if you are going to escape and armband you have to do it very well if you're going to escape unlock with the gean there's a lot of freshets a lot hard to get out so your defenses to be better with no gee you're oftenest to be better because there are no handles to grab the slip reade ple can fly out of the exact opposite reasons so you you i think you improve your offence more and i will say this my dame is compatible with both where i don't do a lot of crazy lapelle weaving in between your legs and up over your back and then back over your right arm pit and round your neck i don't do a lot of that i don't disagree with it i think it's fine but i like you most of the moose that i do um aromatae with both ortheris very small differences between the way have the game set up yet then tending told me that thine thing where when you train in the gee you're defense darted a little bit more cause you got to like or lock you're in the arm locky can't just pass out of an unlocked easy and even more for actually is not the justice submission but across side or amount we get at a cross side on you at a and they've got those candles and its revery nor pages are control is onto all that stuff and like easier to hold them down ye so if you train no gee at you unwholesome down to e it actually takes more technique whole somebody down with no gee than it does with gee even though sometimes i hear people save the gas more technical red i don't actually grew with it i think they're both technical and the round aspect to yes or an even and holding some one down that's more of an offensive move yes it so if your being held down with a gigot a understand the concept in those techniques to get out or whether he being held down or submission or whatever yet onsets concepts and we understand the concepts then you can be successful as the post delectation you don't necessary i mean you should understand the consent for sure but you don't necessary fairly half to because you could just pasotti it or like an armored if your sweaty you could spend out of an arm lockite technique and of your sham on with the gift can be layarde to do that well you are ilskin away learn more and so flat when you go off in the defence seemed kind of thing with the with the nogitsune stuff you got on this and where you got a pensolu der otherwise he's goin to you know have enough room to slide it out for you have to have that perfect control cut a good submission if it is good to em and i i you know it was life what i do life is a trying put myself and told situation so i am practised in them so used to him and you know that's what that's what the physical aspect of life is to dealer to improve you got to challenge herself and put yourself in the horsenails and go and try and get through him when a weather that's a weight room with a scot rack or whether that's a wrong or whether that a swim or whatever that physical challenges you on a you on it make it as difficult to possible or putting yourself out there for putting yourself out there at an as i have challenged myself or outside my comfort one i to the world of humans multimedia yes they say what i've heard that public speaking is the number one fear of people i have er that is well and in it is hard for you like you i have no i do i'm not afraid of getting up and talking on a people like a lady doesn't unionist nd that i do understand what that must feel like it you know so understand why though i ate really armenian a sarradet right well cusan it's do you get nervous talking of on a people get ye a degree i mean obviously depends on the mood depends on the people i let ye a yeah i think i'm really no different than than most upon regard for sure but yet there's a reason for that i think it's because it's it's almost like this sub conscious feeling that everyone's judging every little thing that comes out your mouth everything a little thing that you do move it wise you know so you hole being is being judged by all kinds of different people will all sedaine standards yes and when you care about that or when you paid the price for that may be i think as we know when you get raised i think you pay the price for that if you say the wrong thing if you do the wrong thing yes and i think that in no way ridiculed or will you know whatever whatever you got however that looks for you you've paid the price for a growing up for a imitation a large scale is yes and that's exactly what you got here in a innocenti where that's all kind of coming your coming into your brain where you you fear that price that you're going to pay and it's time thaten because there's a thousand people there and i think it's kind of some conscious all your left with consciously is this just anxiety how we feel for your mind acolytage those bad situations yet yesternoon pelion a public speed or at your afraid of public speaking but of small then or an odd tone i like to come seperation if you don't want to go from zertain you a small one you know to something like with low consequences you know or less in patulcius and disterminat go up is probably what you did so mexique griscom so okay micromanage is how do you deal with micromanage okay so if you work for me and you are super squared away then i was a great possente left you alone if you work for me and you are not squared away i was a complete micromanage so that's a little indicator now i have worked for my grangers before every one does you run into him in the world and the way the the best way i figured to get out from undredweight the micromanage is too trying gained their trust and what you want to do he is you want to be a head of them you want to an acathistus something that i when alone in pairs program i talk about how an i told my dad i was joining the military than i was as rebellious kind of crazy kid and he said o your nadyusha authority i did it anyway and when i got in i was like damn my dad was right i do hate authority i don't like missing to people and now i have to listen to all time and then i realized very quickly unsmit seeton i didn't want any one to tell me what to do and i was in charge of the radishes a radioman and what i did what i did was you know if the radio had to be ready i knew they had to be ready i just got them ready i got ready had of a time i do everything before he went coltel me to do it i would come in to work leave ready before any one could tell me what to do so i basically was completely psychotically proactively and his was a head of the power coroner little thing that i could be had of the power coronative tully didn't take long the people that micromanage me all was unoratorical this gunmore are done it cause every time they say have you have his iordache start praying very onmeanin an event they say okay this kind o best doing sir and what you're trying to do is bill up the trust because that's what it is it's a little it's a little ah lack a trust that people have that thing is going to go the way and they probably learned that somewhere said dan hold against them what did your job to create relationship with them of trust where they stopped micromanage you and move on to somebody else that needs to be micromanage next elgiva wood of family and a and people who are close to you are they all the same and if not how he deal with him so this is the the trials and tribulations of the alfaterna iand early trying to go hard to go fast and make things happen and how do you deal with this is some one at askewe you are thank you for us in question people are people like me all the same and if not cut a deal with it well for small notice not to me before like me then and as a matter of fact there is not to be people like you echo and people that are listening this is not to make people like you either people are unique and i'm not trying to make people like me or make them do the things that i do i i'm over that face you know i've talked botherer like there was a time where i would try and convince people about things and i don't try nonymous but i'm not sure to win and argument i'm i'm not that concerned about you not that concerned about what you think i'll again if if you're someone or friends with him i'm trying to help you i'm concerned but not trying to change people's minds um but it's interesting because one i'm really trying to do as i'm trying to appreciate people's perspectives i'm trying to laerum other people and on this is at speaking of twitter um on twitter the other day i posted a a little paragraph in its by a gay guide named a mark riputato ch she's written you know probably one of the best on us books about weight lifting that you can get its called starting strength basic barbel training margaret ate but the opening of it is freaking awesome and i brought it with me so i could read it to you ah so here's piers this this opening to this book about weightless in physical strength is the most important thing in life this is true whether we wanted to be or not as humanity is developed throughout history physical strength is become less critical to our daily existence but no less important to our lives our strength more than any other thing we possess still determines the quality and the quantity of our time here in these bodies whereas previously or physical strength a termine how much food we ate and how warm and dry we stayed it now merely determines how well we function these new surroundings we have grafted for ourselves as our culture as a commuted but we are still animals our physical existence is in the final analysis the only one that actually matters a weak man is not as happy as the same man would be if he were strong this reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence it is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up now that freaking epic right that is an epic call out to the passion that contrived as write this is awesome so i put that on to a rosshire up you know and cause old mentioned starting strength and i said yes course you know this is a a classic and ah some somebody on twitter um row back and it said i disagree i will avoid reading things like this and i broke back in again amoton to argue with anybody um i just wrote back pay when i don't agree with people on a subject i don't know if haiti just try and learn from it and and a factor the matter is even though i think what coach road is awesome i actually going agree with it i don't think that strength is the most important thing in life i think knowledge is more powerful lasting respect in loyalty and honour and treating people well i think all the things are more important in strength and there's been people that morning credibly weak in the world that of one amazing things and were powerful leaders and work incredible human beings so i don't actually you know believe that strength is literally the most important thing now that ben said um if you are smart if you are an intellectual than you realize that you should use that knowledge be strong so you can not be fiscally bullied for you can be healthy she competent yourself see can be soleiman there is no doubt that strength is a is powerful for thought like i said there's many other things that i think are more important now but but what i like about it is that hearing this opinion brought into my mind it makes me smarter it made me understand how importance strength is to some people and may be that it should be more important my head because it onto claret that for the first time years ago is like you know what that awesome and i should always keep somewhere in my mind that being strong is it port and being strong is good any thin this day and age people actually i think believe that being strong as bad as crazy as that might sound there's nothing wrong with being strong you know being strong as good never mind nothing wrong it's a good thing to be strong i wish i was stronger i trying get stronger and i'm not a naturally strong person i'm just kind of an average person that works out one so my point therise one when you get people that are different than you don't t i don't try change them i try to keep an up open mind i try and born from them i'm trinita about this earlier to night people have strength and people have weaknesses and if people have strengthen the chilean from the strengths and some people are adore weaknesses and i try and learn from that as well you get someone notanda you get someone that's a a a a a social path or you can some one that's a you know a real giver or some one helps his people that one thing that that i i don't feel like i help a people enough um so i was look at people that are very helpful and i say okay what can i do if i take away from their perspective but you know if i meet some one that's an addict i learned from them they teach me very important lessons people at a winter's people that are losers on on a loan from both of them now back to the original question love how do you deal with it it bedimming from the question that this person that asked it it frustrated that others are not inlying up to their expectations now this is going to sound bad when i say this initially is that i actually have relatively or shenativ i keep relatively low expectations of humans meaning when i meet some one i don't expect to get a lot out of them i expect to be let do i expect people at the tarbut the other day people are crazy in and i expect that i expect people to do a rational things so that's kind of my base line and then what beautiful botanist i am surprised and happy and in she prelaty surprised when people are supportive would be for reliable when people are good people when they make sense when they're not crazy in so i think setting the right level of expectations is important to keep yourself from going crazy trying to change people on the other thing i like about this addite is i'm not setting her blaming on other people around me amaban whether it's my family whether my team whether it's my people i work with i'm not blaming them for being on motivated or blaming them from not trying hard orbling them for whatever i'm just taking responsibility for what's happening in my for me i'm taking responsibility if they're not motivated i need timothei i carbon if they are dragging me down whose fault is it that's not therefule i'm letting them drag me down so i'm taking responsibility of my interactions with people to make sure i move in the right direction and as a leader it's my job to get the most out of people i mean i always talk to that you're going to have your whole team is not going to be studs you're going to have people in your team that are weak and it's your job to get what you can out of that person take advantage of whatever strength it might have convertere weaknesses while you can that's what you're doing is a leader and you're leading whether that's leading in business or your team or your group of friends or whatever you're taken a leadership position and you get what you can not a people and that's how i deal with people at our close to me that are not the same as me don't want to hang around with a bunch do i don't mind hangon people that are like me he has is pretty the seems as a lot of people with the similar you know they're like got some similar ah personalities in there which is only alentours um are there it so we say you have um lopetty is there as a etona impolite people of the world right now ye that when i look at you i have lockerian don't think of it that way ye i'm think in my own mind i'm just setting lorikeets are you assonet a lot you know yes that lay like little expect sheetiness you expect you just don't expect a duly yes yes so some on making this you know tall claim you don't expect that claim to be fulfilled a hundred per cent or you know or whatever i sat i shut lorleian and i looked to be pleasantly surprised by those people of the world the people that are listening to this potato all out there even you i fire me uf you know you but but i thought really is it you know most people that you mean you can't rely on red and that's why it important to find people that are like minded and lincolns with them and go forward and to the fray yet and it's not like people are unreliable lecipice it's just that if you set your own specific expectations on people because every different you're different like or you think so if you set your specific expectations which i think most of us do that in one way or another that we expect certain things not all away down to the language we o some people you know some people don't like if they are called boss you know you're a boss the boss fonteboa like that when stimcoe bosinney don't know you name you know he brooding boss but they meant it in a good way right you know but i bacheet you never to use that word when you address me kind o thing goneness but any way thus siculis if you start setting our own expectate your specific on expectations consciously answer consciously yet you you you'll troyton your westonfelton it your volanerius e is and i run it is with business leaders where van know derserve cheever's and they expect that level for fomentation enter not gittagoin way explained to my celoron i understand what you want to have happened but just because as a leader the lead the potion commander is able to carry a hundred pound rock back ten colomies into the target hit the target and walk about out another ten calamites a dozen men that everybody else in the potence do it and therefore he cannot plan that mission and i will usually get to to him on that because they do realize that there hypersomnia and that there knocking it so how you en a set the expectations so that orpheo people that cannot actually achieve the expectations you set for them let's ride on point ma but sir yes the ledgermen fetes look and alopecia i know sounds like them be that but let them be there to you and that way when you get let if you get let down actually you probably have a less canto getting let down torgesen your minimizing the downside maximizing the upside after ponderel huntercraft yes you are terrecino for making me give me a posishin to my negative attitude and then a theatin i think i understand what you mean i think so part of it a denial by the way totient every admit or think that i had liepen as me in my ficiate okay we'll go next washin aikawa are the top there the top three to ten business problems your asked us off goquie interesting question cause why would you say topical orofenan say for your four o three to five maybe but three to ten on a vaccinator three we will go for it at that being said here's the problem here's a problem that we come up against an layered with on a regular basis it is we get called in do do either a lack of execution or desire to improve execution and this is the same thing we dealt with with work with leadership in the sultans you get teams that are not executing correctly that's that's the problem that we come into salt now that execution could be production that execution could be sales that execution could be manufacturing it could be anything that execution so that's what we always get asked us off that being said why is there a proven execution in the follows these are where you get like the aqua five to seven condoctors that we deal with sweetest we dress move of most of them on fact we dress all the major ones in in the book there's a few new ones to one but ah you don't then generally the issues are like a you can't get people to buy in and we owe her that or our folks aren't buying it in an intent lyin the lot of plan or while strategy whatever ah people don't understand what's happening they don't they don't derstand the vision and we go back obselete understand the wire are they is how is the vision being communicated how is the vision being translated up and down the chainman because you go down from the sea o who has a vision in the way he would speak to that vision is a lot different than the way a front line you know equipment operator is full now on understand that vision so is this strategy simple and understandable through the chain of command that can cause a lack of extrusion ardesia are there different elements within the company that are not helping each other and supporting each other with a good cover move is there micromanage we are talked about my commencement my romanet can cause legitimate problems of execution is there on clear guidance that can cause problems is there ego in her fearing the hackensall is there he godridg process instead of the best methodology driving process sometimes it egotising process so it's all these and there's just these problems and there we've seen them all i i don't think i've seen a new problem yet in quite some time on satanee seen this before and we sit we and there always these problems of execution or leadership promised and we see the same thing in some way in this celtis i think that's why we've been successful at the company going in and getting people to execute better because we seen it we know how to fix it and that's what we do frauelein is how do you handle a boss that doesn't know as much as you and they don't understand what you do but their boyish the boy okay so this is actually a normal situation is not abnormal bosses often don't know as much as the form minyo i can tell you right now i was the boss of thirty five or forty seals when i was attacking to command her and i didn't know as much as they knew about vergors i didn't know what the snipers knew about sniping i know everything that the radio men about knew about the radios i didn't know like layelah was working with their races every i didn't know about his araised on what they were like i couldn't portento know that stuff but i was actually secured natica okay with that and that's what i recognized that that wasn't my job and i was okay with it so the course is how do you deal with some one like that well let's first recognize the fact that they antiscriptural able to like let my guys run stuff because i was secure with my self as a leader and my position when you're do with some of it still bo they're trying to impose upon you how to do things and that is because the rude ofthat is likely i don't want to call it out as a hundred per cent but the rutat is likely in security esistere about as authority and secured about his leadership in secure about his position so when you want to deal with it how do you deal with your job become in this situation to make your boss feel secure in their position that's what you're galegos that means and an yes you know that means it means not a your head and and giving them credit when they might not deserve it and inflating their eagle on manslaying but must singing very ego a little bit and you know what that means the hardest part of that isn't messagerie horse part of his checking your own ego the horse part of that is saying is is you want to prove to them that you know more than they do and that you dubbleson over it it will rule your relationship and it will ruin the the job that you're trying to do make them feel secure seaboat all your wrong it's this will your eagle feels good be gasha you just hurt his you go now as what he goes they're goin to do trinette more will upon you so you actually gone backwards you win the battle you lose the war so what sonnet do is make that boss feel secure musahar ego don't try and prove that you know more trynete you are there to support and help and in a long run that will be the beneficial way to prove that relationship let them recognize or let them feel secure with what they at where there at and then they won't impose triumpos a will on you as a bosman yet this that and a what you penalosa i think last time um is it is a small tiny siout i think it's really important when you tread when you're doing that when you're convincing or or making them feel more secure as a bosonides to come off genuine and consistent ebreos a lot of people all be little patuone do and then they overtly want to show that that's what they're doing we are beante people or because you know maybe they got scolded or or whatever in front of other panthan so they overtly do it and it is a come off is genuine then it's conoposis you know yes this is called with his race to call the shell teams classic over correction for an cassovia you know we see guys go too far in one direction as were talkin about the picotee leadership and i'd say to a guy oh you're doing a you're doing too much you're not doing enough to centralize command any do crassicornis they would lose control everything or they if we told him every one's too while they never put ordering they'd gone of level nine micromanage men you know and just lock every one down so yet you don't want to do a classicalities you want to you want to moderate and modulate your efforts to make the person feel secure no doubt about it can you apply extreme ownership at mid level management versus the cessile well this is a diis absolutely true um can you apply extreme undershirt the the leadership principles are we talk about an extreme ownership can you apply them at mid level management verses the executive level the the sea sweet folks and answers absolutely yes and not only that but i shemonoseki through the entire chain command the principles are meant for every one inside the jinemon because as we talk about all the time the leadership this doesn't mean the actual um designated leaders every person on the team needs to be aleator and while that may sound please it is actually true so not not only that but the deseno executives that accompany the sea o the they were for somebody they whom they work for a board a whether it yenoske jobs in charge of apple guess what he's reporther folders so every one has some kind of boss every one's work in for somebody and everybody needs to use these principles all the way up and down the china command the principles of leadership don't change no matter where you are in the chainman or what situation your and that's why you know we're getting we get called in to help every level of the chatiment from the front line troops from literally from the front line troops the the equipment operators the operators in the fields the sales people on the front lines we work with them all boato the sea sweet and above yet dislike how your tigerland to everybody and in every situation it's a it's absolutely true like in life in a relationship with your husband or wife and in the relationship with your kids they exact thing to like if you're a taking responsibility for everything you did wrong and right right i oatman me take responsibility for the right thing it is but if you're taken responsibility i think that's when you find eventually function the way that that you hope that you'd be able to function you are correct just to be clear bowen you do do something right and you are in a leadership position you actually don't take responsibility for it you pushed that you pushed that praiseful to the tales you never want to ensure that ain't that advance or that's actually white felt mateless question i think ah how do you deal with sat back failures delays defeat or other disasters how do you deal with set back failures delays defeat or other disasters actually have a fairly simple way of dealing with these situations is actually one work to deal with all those situations and that is good asatoma that one of my direct of order to one of my guys that work for me pointed out to me and he would heathcote up or pull me aside with some major problem some issue that was going on and he take assiout there said nat ne other thing and i look at him and say good in finding one day he was tell me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said i already know what you're going to say he said well what am i essayed you're goin to say good he said that's what you always say when something is wrong and going bad you always just look at me and say good and i said will you and and i mean it that is how i feel when things are going bad there is going to be some good that's going to come from it and to mission got canceled good we can pose focus on the other one um didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted good wouldn't keep it simple didn't get promoted good more time to get better didn't get funded good we all more the company didn't get the job you wanted good you can get more experience and build a better resume god in your god injured spring my ankle good editorial from training got tapped out good better to tap and training than the tap out on the street got be good you learned unexpected problems good we have the opportunity to figure out a solution matitation things are going bad don't get old bumboosers don't get frustrated no and just look at the issue and you say good awites something that's all cleeshin mister palsified apposite but do that focus on the good take that issue take that problem and make it something good i'll bring that attitude to your team too you go forward and lasting like to close this out if you can say the word good guess what i medusidae immenso still breathing and if you're so breathing wollnow you still got some fight left in you so get up dust off reload recalibrate re engage and go out on the attack and that right there is about as good as i gets that's all i got for to day so every one that's been lessen thank you for your patience
