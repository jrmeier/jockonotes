this is jacopo cast number thirteen with echo charles and me jackwell can this is extracted from a u s army f m three tack o six dot on one combined arms operations in urban duranton the collapse of the soviet union the people's chechia began to seek full independence by nineteen ninety four cashier fallen into civil war between pro independents and pro russian factions in december it ninety four russia sent forty thousand troops in the chestnut restore russian primacy over the break away republic an attack was launched by six thousand mechanized troops against the cession capital of grown instead of the anticipated light resistance rushing forces encountered heavy resistance from the cessions armed with mass of amounts of anti tank weapons the russians will repulse which shockingly high losses it took them another two months of heavy fighting and changing their tactics before they were able to capture drawne begin between january and may nineteen ninety five russian losses in cheshire approximately put thousand eight hundred killed ten thousand wounded and over five hundred missing or captured the chechen cash the chasing casualties were also eye especially among non combatants this war is a major and cautionary episode in military history the large scale lessons of chestelaine areas it showed again the limited effectiveness of heavy weaponry in urban terrain and by extension the crucial in portions of well trained well lad well equipped and highly motivated infantry it proved again that a society judged permitid or chaotic by western standards can still generate a tremendous fighting spirit and very effective military discipline this is not a new lesson susa little introduction to the focus forty day and that this soviet on chestnote breakaway republic and its just urban combat the urban combat and that's what i find it very fascinating and i remember the first time i started to the first significant moment when i remembered a hearing about the lesson learn from gesnerus you know you watch it you you you we all watch it i was in the military at the time you know um but the first time i rummer hearing about the lessons learned was actuating through officer candidate school in nineteen ninety eight and for one of her reason is a one the ring coronta had had put this series of lessons learnt of the russian military upon the wall and this is something i talk about occasionally is that the the the lesson that i remembered seeing there was that it was when they when they stopped shaving when the wind the rushing troops stopped shaving it was like the beginning of the end discipline fell apart moral fell apart and everything turned into a disaster nor punch of other letters and analogo that specific document and i haven't been able to find it so i don't know what is the cific document or was that said apportioned others that are close to that but what's interesting is that now on this this field manuals army field mandelet am weeding from ah was actually polished in two thousand and two so we had definitely looked it at this war it was brutal and if you antagonism dark places you can go into some dark place is because it is one of the first it definitely is one of the first where were you had you don't information warfare happening meaning there was propaganda coming out home a propaganda you can see don't you to poesia lly from the chassised of just brutal brutal behavior yes and they were doing that purposely to strike fear into the hearts of the rushing soldiers and they they did they were effective in doing that they did do that yes crazy ol they make those videos of the little everybody they do it is it is crazy so as we digito the little bit this is still from within the fantee tack one of six but there quoting lessons learned from the world turned upside down military lessons of the chechen war by mister and a tall lean and he said it cannot be emphasized too strongly therefore that the key to success in argentariae is good infantry and the key to good infantry rather than good weapon try is a traditional mixture of training leadership all these in endos and junior grade officers and moral in plying a readiness to take casualties so this is classic this is what we this is what remote was all about as well you know god infantry which they absolutely had great and sealed reship which they absolutely add to junior officers were out standing and the moral which which he says the morals a readiness to take casualties and in leone of the things that no doubt about it colonel shaw mcfarlin that was running the brigade he had to overcome that fear that many people had which was what you push into these and making full territories you are going to take casualties it is going to happen you cannot avoid it and that's something that we seals had to deal with his well because seals had been in a been in iraq fired three years at this point and not had any seals killed in action so this idea that we are going to push into this heavy erben fighting men to as we were going to we were going to take out of these at some point the us back to the book the u s will not always have the ability of pick and choose its wars and the key reason cashmeres that there will always be military actions in which it determined infantry men will remain the greatest asset and that is very near and dear my art knowing that it's not the technology it's not the the drome it's not the air craft it's the infantrymen it the soldier that makes the difference and the leader the leaders of those soldiers that make the difference now here was the marine corps analysis first of all strategic lessons military operations alone cannot solve decided political problems okay military commanders need clear policy guidance from which they could work steadily and logically confusion generated by missing or conflicting policy guidance is made worse by poorly defined lines of command and control so those first two messages right there are all about clear dident and this happens to old time in the businessworld where you don't see clear guidance making it all the way down to the front lines of the canican russian seen your command back caught ney and was plagued by two much senor leadership involvement at the lower operational level lack got newtie is got to be clear message that every leaders can be basically saying the same fundamental message contrary to initial expectation operations were neither of short duration or low cast when russian security operations began achieving results the chesson started attacking targets within russia it was difficult to unite police and military units into his single coheir distinct that go advantages a crew to the side with less concern for the safety of the civilian population that is something that we absolutely dealt with in remote again it's that the distinct tactical advantage accrue to the side with less concern for the safety the idlin population this was of utmost concern to every soldier and marie on the ground in remond was trying to protect the civilian population and of course the alcander on that we were facing did not care and all about the civilian population or neither buildings or another their lives or children women are anything else concerned about civilian casualties and property destruction declined as casualties among russian forces rose so initially the russians were also concerned about silin gaulte but as they started taking casualties got worse and worse here some operational lessons having a well developed military doctrine for urban warfare is not enough in and of itself god have that creativity doctrine does not answer everything situation oriented training what have improved russian military effect inness an organ talk about that later to day but situation oriented training in that is when you put yourself in situations in you make people half petting its not about executing pretty plan moves just like in the immortal art is not about being able to do a cotta and do a movement that's not what it's about it's about reacting to another free thinking human being and in this case a group of free thinking human being how to react in those situations and there in specific situations as well or right like the situation judith de situational train of re like okahha'wis on top you know you start all over if you you know have to guy whatever loverina part start all over it now you have carinatae training in the most basic manoeuvre and combat skills in a habited russian operations so you've got to be trained up in the basic no down about it urban combat is extremely man power intensive and produces significant attrition of men and material among the attackers overwhelming fire power can make up for organizational and tactical deficiencies in the short run if one is willing to disregard collateral damage so yet you can just bomb bomb the crap out of places and you can make up for your tax going or ization proms in the short run if you don't care about a clattering you know this is we we we don't do that we as americans don't do that i care about cladel damage the sudden requirement to deplore a cheshire with the unique supply problems posed by the weather and the urbanities overwhelmed the already fragile russian military egisti system and eludes bullet points by the way of the sound stilted the way on reading out the ring bullet after bullet a lack of high quality intelligence made operations more difficult and dangerous on the russian forces the geometry and perspectives of urban combat are very different from combat in the open urbano's much more vertically oriented so in in the desert you do have elevation you know you have all mountains whenever sisithes vertically oriented things that yafta with but an earthern combat every you know every foot can be separated by a tense torsonse it is a three hundred sixty degree environment not to mention you get subterranean situations you have basements you have sellers you have underground sewers and pipes and things ah a tonal that go from building a building so it's a three hundred and sixty degree environment for a sure fratricide was a serious and continuing problem throughout the campaign in chechia because it was difficult to tell friend from foe that friendly fire that friendly fire and missus theotoricus ly in our book i start off from me the the first chapter is about a fresh site that opisso obviously we learned this you know in the in the most horrible way and anybody that's been in hard core urban combat and a gin im a hackin about doing it in operation with let's say won you knit against a bad guy in an urbaniores i'm talking about erbin and combat were young multiple you that's all over the place friendly units in buildings on roads and their mixed in hers away elater mixed in with enemy and it becomes very very gaeing stand a russian military unit configurations were inappropriate for ben combat for going peace time maintenance is a false economy so there's something to think about lineament he for good when you say you know what there's nothing going on right now will just kind of slack off women give you know what i don't need to train in the offices there i don't have to prepare right now i guess what you do you do need to prepare right now it's it's a lie to think you're going to get away with it the potential of special forces for urban operations was never realized in cheshire we realized it remade for sure an out of work it the nature of cities tends to channel combat operations a long narrow lanes of activity that justitiarius and and just like when you're in down town san diego in the gaslamp district gassating are channel on to long narrow look long narrow lines of activity it's called a road that's kind of an obvious one tactless wearious communications security is essential even against relatively primitive enemies in this is the others found out was at the the gestion many of whom spoke russian they then lessart acosmist enrabio commands they would they would actually get on the radio and give false commands though it was it was just a nightmare for them now in that in america we have very high we sophisticated incriptions systems sidis's really no factor for us night fighting was the single most difficult operation in chester for infantry forces again this is something that we are very good at we being america we are awesome at fighting at night we have incredible capability or a night vision we do it all the time actually that's that's worth much in the reason that were good at it could we do it all the time m we train it all time we do it all the time and which is i used to be a living in that way when you to live in a nagree world of night vision tankapic cannot operate in cities without extensive dismounted infantry support now remodeled they absolutely operated then they operated with a phenomenal success but they but they did have an in participate usually very close by oh well they were a they did push and doth domremie operations on their own as well forces operating in cities need special equipment not usually found in the russian tale which is the basically the table organization of comicalest of normal things that they had light weight ladders were invaluable for assaulting infantry this is all my first opponent to iraq we actually oh we we did built that ladders we millie two by four laterals over the place that we didn't we just have ladders have hoped on them these when we him we just pop off let it not a bear wood that we other wills far wood and let any force trained snipers were a cento but in short supply we had plenty as nighters obscuring or specially useful in fighting in cities smoker nights and other ways of blocking vision but ye that that's one of those things when worsted in the field teams and we would learn like a cat through smoke and which throw a smoke you can run away an he kind of illness seems like a joke a most irritat almost sounds funny when i e like bad manage it's almost like that man or or james bond you know and get him to smoke on it's freaking real it's real like you throw that smoke out you let that smoke start to pour out and then all of a sudden you can get out of here he and it's a ginnistan that it almost seems like a joke when you first hear about when you are a kid like weight really that a real farenthal thing is recovering damaged armored vehicles is especially difficult cities a we absolute learned at that to you in sergeant out dozens of tanks and brave fighting vehicles and home ties and it was always very difficult for the engineers to get in there and get those things out of their a failure of small unit leadership especially at the end so level was a primary cause of russian tactical failures in gray so when you hear me say beatership is the most important thing on the battlefield that is what i am talking about m that is exactly what i am talking about and it's the same thing in business as is the same thing in pans and is the same thing in life with talk about leadership when not just hackenbush over alberson in charge of talking about leadership at every level ye both sides employed commercial off the shelf that knowledge from military purposes be ready for that you know in in remote they the enemy absolutely used no remote rollo walk cakes they had moral bastions at of a man they were they were using it that go communications proved very difficult and grown again you can't change the laws of physics and radio waves cannot punch through more than you know a couple of two three buildings so once you get a couple two or three buildings away you're not going to be able to talk to gather you nits you know may be four five buildings and the only way to do to get on the roof tops m and so you know i was almost always on a roof top because i was till my man roll was usually to make communications with the very troops that were out there army and my giant so i was almost owes on wilton with a big old ententing off my shoulder and that's when you know when one of the guys needed doctor me lady to go to the top and did catch me the cabs of supply trucks must be armed at no doubt about that bunker busting weapons are invaluable for urban and combat missus something that we used a tone was the callosity four millimetre big thunder helicopters are not well suited for urban combat and there is no doubt about that one again in remote we found that any time alcoves came into remote they received so much small arms fire that they left immediately it was just too hot for them to go into these situations when i options in what is it take to to you know take down a helicopter dicker i mean the the take one round right it's someone like a human body and others of some one in the right spirit spot you could you could take it out but um so it's really hard to put like a an absolute on that but you know generally they can take they can take some punishment this vessel the apaches which are are you know pretty well armored but they're not well armored enough to get in there and do what they would want to do right so they end up to take in some around it they deal they couldn't they can stay yes like if you hit in that love that that rear propeller ye maybe you hit it in the weak spot there's going to be issues which i won't talk about a righteous the marine cornelis and again this is all from the same manuel but i'm going to imago into the sod that covers what the ring cornelis had and now this is the u s army infantry school also is russian army at lessons learned from the battle grained to culturally orient your forces so you don't end up being your own worst enemy simply out of cultural in ignorance many times russian soldiers needs serious cultural errors in dealing with the cheshireman once insulted or mistreated the cessions became active fighters or at least supported the active fighters russian to men they under estimated that the effect of religion of the conflict so you got a new your enemy and go on now your friends and this is something that they definitely ah they definitely make that important in the us notary that you know you got understand the local culture and there was a true hero named travis patrician who we will have to do a show on at some point but gravitate from was with us over and iraq and remote and he was just credible smart die and a former assagy you was ten e became a a cap in the army and he spoke arabic and he's the guy really that started saying look salgath make friends with these locals and he ended up producing this this actually pretty famous power point brief that just had a bunch of stick they orsov haesslich guide this was you as as what you see him as but this what he really is and this is what you know and it was a great a great a document a very simple document and brilliant in its simplicity in the way i explained in a penitent up being circulated all the place and that was written by a kind of travers patriots the gin for carious guy very nice guy and really had a vision of it a full understanding of the arabic culture the trial culture the shake that were there in remote and he didn't mazin job moving that whole singing and that whole peace of the battle he didn't amazing job moving passford and making sure that we were culturally oriented to to understand the local and unfortunately after we left her madiana they were still there captain patricentric in travbach in was in a vehicle i think he was heading south on a road condensed in had nadan he was killed in action in it was a tragic loss of an incredible not lingerie soldier pothouse inclinable woman some day will i will go to some more depth about about travbach in because he really had a huge embanked next bullet point you need it some way of sorting out combatants from not combatants the russians were forced to resort to search in the pockets of civilians from military equipment and a sniffing them for the smell of gunpowder and gun oil this is crude and not very reliable trained dogs were used to tactum of gunpowder ekspres but will not always effective never less specially trained on paredes wanted determine if a person has been using explosive for firing a weapon recently what was good for us was it ortalons de the iraqi soldiers they could tell makokel where people will from the catel where their accent was from they could tell but a couple of questions to who could tell you're the iraqi soldiers would we went to speak to some random iraqi civilians yet they could take attentuation be able tone a million years just like it if you took an iraqis in a herrenburg em in a room with a guy from new jersey eating from southern california and a guy from georgia they wouldn't be able to tell where news people were but any american could talk to any of those three people and immediately know where they were ages we used the iraqi soldiers to help us that inter also or interpreters we had you know a interpreters that had both fooling and generally came from either iraq or some other arabic speaking country and so they had the same knowledge and they could do the same thing the psychological impact of high intensity urban combat is so intense unit should maintain a large reserve that will allow them to rotate units in an out of combatant if a commander does this he can preserve a unit for a long time if he doesn't once it gets used up it cannot be rebuilt so that the statement about the psychological impact if intensity urban combat and there's so many little things that make this true you know i do talk about the three hundred sixty degrees threat there is the ed there's the savilian populace there is the close inviting their all these things that make erben combat the most intense kind of combat psychologically and you have to be careful with your troops to make sure that you give them enough time out of the fight that they can maintain a long deployment in that sort of intensity and the russian did not always do a very good job of that next bullet training and discipline are paramount you can accomplish nothing without them you may need to do the training in the combat discipline must be demanded once it begins to slip the results are disastrous that is something i believe in across the board i think you mentioned that before hitahita have mentioned that a few times there is again training in discipline or paramount discipline must be man did once begins to slept the results are disasters have to hold the line on the discipline you have the russians were surprised and embarrassed at the degree to which the chechenses the use of cellphones motor radios improvised t v stations light wet that i cameras and the internet to win the information warm the russian hadmitted that they lost control of the information coming out a grassy early in the operation and never regained it as expected the russians were eered the need for large numbers of trained infantry men they said that some tasks such as conducting a log pack that's logistics operations could only be conducted by infantrymen the egisti units soldiers were hopelessly in nepotes military skill such as permanere defense establishing security over watching so forth and there be thereby fell easy prey to the cessions so that something that our troops in america have ever really done an outstanding job of adapting tutelage tics suboo ple being combat ready cause every time you you know if you're of europe supply guy in the army and you got to bring whatever it is water food ammunition from bagdad to remonitory doing a combat a town a and you you could likely get it back and so america did a really good job of getting their folks trained up to run these convoys and you know the logistics teams that supplied the war fighter the front line troops they came under all kinds of attacks and did it outstanding job so all you folks that are listening that will run in those logistics con voice thank you and you did not stand in job in another a huge risk every time you rolled out the front gate next bullet they found that down trees between units world still tact go weak points but that it wasn't just a horizon bade boundaries that they had to worry about in some cases the chechens held the third for above while the russians held the first two fors and sometimes the roof if a unit holding the second floor of vacuated parts of it without telling the nonagon for the cessions would move troops in and a tact he ground for unito the seawing offen this resulted fratricide is a ground for unit responded with uncontrolled fire through all of the ceilings including the ones below that section of building still occupied by the russians entire battles were fall through for ceilings and walls without visual contact that's got be scary right ambushes were common sometimes they actually had three tears chechens would be under ground on the ground for and altero each group added different task in the end bushes common responses by the chassant the increasingly powerful russian the indirect ariel indirect and arial fire power was hugging the russian unit the hugging tactics caused the russians to sorry if the hugging tactic caused the russians to cease artillery and air fires it became a man to man fight and the chesson's were well equipped to win it if they didn't cease the supporting fire the russian unit suffered just as much as the chestings did sometimes even more and the moral of fact was much worse on the russians so there's i mean it's very simple coff the enemy is going to use or the russians are going to use big bombs and big artillery and big bands from the sky to to defeat us we'll just get so close in wall is closed the distance and be so close that you are a drop arms your inkier own people yet both the physical and mental health of the russian units began to decline overseein upon initiation of high intensity combat in less than a month of a twenty per cent of the russian soldiers were suffering from fire all hepatitis which the very serious depelli debilitating with slow recovery most had chronic diarrhea and upper reportorial factions that turned to numonia easily this was blamed on the break down of logistical support that met units had a drink contaminated water unit sanitary discipline broke down almost completely so that disappoint like i said startit the shaving in the next letourneur water extingo know your sick and the next in you now your crap and all over the place and extenuate people you make another people sick and it starts with the discipline and according to a survey of over thirteen hundred troops is a russian troops madamed ately after the fighting about the seventy two per cent had some sort of psychological disorder almost seventy five per cent adonaite startled responses that's like when it allowed noises shudder from it about oceanie per cent had an exaggerated start warspite do want eight per cent had what was described as narrow emotional and almost ten per cent had acute emotional reactions the russians recommended to psycho physiologists on psycho farmer colleges one psychiatrist and one medical psychologist at each us corise unit at the huge recommendation from mental health another experience afghanistan prepared them somewhat from the physical health problems they were not prepared for this level of mental health treatment many permanent combat stress casualties resulted from soldiers not being provided proper immediate treatment again the boils down to how harsh that urban combats and they were not ready for it they were not ready for the psychological damage that that urban combat does to the soldier's mind out giant head and you got the startled response the emotional cue reactions to the nightmare the nightmare that i keep emotional reactions of like like what the letter deicoon averytown than chasing one afraid of tanks or bemperly abraiding vehicles basically the armor personal character kario the most part with a big gun on top they assigned droops of arpeggios to fire follies at the lead and trail vehicles once these were destroyed others were picked off one by one of this abattre some facts the russian forces of twenty of twenty six tanks a hundred and two of a hundred and twenty imps in the first three days of fighting ye so imagine you got a convoy of twelve vehicles with a tanker that taking the back and the cheshire out the front and back are now now that what your stock and the teeterin pick of interstitial stuck check this is also important chesson's chose firing positions high enough or low enough to stay out of the fields of fire of the tag and be impains you know the the angle of fire can only go so high and so low so they do stayed out of those two angles russian conscript in contremet imes rough used to dismount and often died in their impious ever firing a shot so this is this a nightmare or vehicle got it and if you know anything when you vehicle at it or like your convoy givit get out in other words if the vehicle can't move cause it's trapped by other vehicles root trap by the road or tripartite get out of the vehicle get out of elentae down a building get out of vehicle and moved to cover get out but get out of a vehicle to the vehicle just a bullet magatha point and in our big macheson get out of there russian eliaphet did much better but didn't coordinate well with armed vehicles initially so i can tell you that we coordinated with the armored vehicles beautifully and we loved them we loved the us army armour that we were with absolutely loved him and we carnate with them and we worked together with them in a beautiful manner chasings were brutish especially with prisoners some reports say the russians were no better but most save that the chechens were the worse of the two sides who ever was at fault the battle degenerated quickly to one of no quarter asked none given rushing wounded and dead were hung upside down in the windows of defended gesson positions russians had to shoot at the bodies to engage the cheshires in prisoners were to capitate and at night their heads were placed on stakes beside the road leading into the city over which rushing replacements and reinforcements had to travel seedin' think of that in this day and age that's something you you read about this repelaer from the history books but there is and this is nineteen ninety four a teniet five nineteen ninety six heads all in a state both russian and cheshire a quartile boyrak were russians were not surprised by the ferocity and brutality of the cheshunt they were surprised by the sophistication of the chesson use of buitran and mines cessions mind and bobyaan showing excellent insight into the actions and reactions of the average russian soldier mine and buitran ss was hargument is as you look at this more i mean they they bobetinski that they talk about em how they showed him sidere acies and reactions the attraction sort they knew what would attract him they knew what they couldn't keep their hands off of and that's what they do be trath some most shiny objects some rule something that looked expensive or something out larbrie it was poberow that kind of wraps up that first a book but i pulled out some other little articles that i thought answered information this one hears rushing tact calescens learned from fighting chechense aratus by timothy l thomas this section with regard to general ambush guidance cause law offered the following first and foremost mobile wise you will knowledge and experience no matter how difficult this may be in order to reestablish command in control repulse the enemy attack seized the initiative and report the situation that that is an that is a powerful statement and it's a palferine to react to any situation first and foremost marble eyes you will i love in visioning the will as light a military unit first and foremost mobilize will bring it to bear wake up well it's time to do on in college and football we say one i heard the southerly fifty dollar day saved buckle up in carupanan it buckled up in gardell dear some you know get ready to to girl mobile eyes your well your knowledge experience no matter how difficult this mutteeanee reestablished command and control so you lost it saying mobilize reestablished command a control up pale the enemy attack these the initiative and report the situation has some damn good advice some damn good advice more psychological support also was a training area for improvement of the thicket a concern here were the mood swings that were observed among russian servicemen during combat seines drastic moods wings and in so much of this was like a logical on the russians and russian for hard people i came were not there i thought about soft people these are russians i mean a russian or hard people the end was of such train would be to improve the service in the fighting spirit use of common sense rational to overcome confusion the ability to act boldly actively in decisively in battle and the ability to achieve ones assigned goal again this is a talking about training the mind to think do you come and sent what you want to do with all your people in care what business you're in whether you are aware whether your business whether in some kind of team train the mind to use common sense train the mind for the ability to act boldly and decisively cantering the mind got a free your mind now that same article pulled out russian lesson learned from speckots gorgonian sportive and the authors were c nixon and as caslette called this one section the commandments for servicemen and chesham and what they actually were was choral tips on cultural sensitivities for russian soldiers and they are as false showered through these this is a directive on how to treat other human beings that your delineation rush in american subordinate superior doesn't matter will the title in an tips on cultural sensitivities frisians one always maintain oothout among the local populace the chassons are very critical of people who try to create a false authority for themselves a so cold patronizing attitude towards others usually afflicted those who cannot gain a fury through other means we talk about this all the time he don't run around throwing your rank out he makes you look like a jack ass next avoid unwarranted confiscations and unforunate requisitions of food and property that one makes pretty easy sense don't steal from people next and be fair every local habitat must be guilt with firmly but fairly in justice gives rise to negative attitude in any person so pefore reward a cheshire performs is a tulasi task well to complish task that you need to get accomplished chose the most affirative person among the local inhabitants and get him to carry out the task if he does the job right in deuice you should reward the elder by giving him additional authority by giving some kind of gift reward repeople when they do a good job the horse saying here when dealing with chassinis displayed calm a display a sense of calm and self worth you will achieve more huge vests than to screaming obscenities never be a cheshire goes on to say chesson's are a proud people with a very intense sense of pride and self farthermore you will chief nothing by humiliating them by screaming at them and by abusing them you only in bitter them right this is how you treat other people and it goes on to say even in casual conversation do not give orders and do not use profanity that you might normally use as interjection and ejections so this ideal of yew and scream in i think your people would do what you won the dew doesn't work next respect cession women girls old men and children as if they were russians always remembered the chechens respect manly qualities therefore never permit any disrespect vulgarity with regard to their women never allow yourself to curse it to fences people in revenge for the outrages of militant against russian women old men and children so keep herself in check mature you are not blaming people for something that somebody else did studying be respectful of national creations the more you know about the chassis natural tritons the more you understand their behavior that means you will be able to predict their action at the same time a person that respects the local traditions will be respected himself g what a novel idea no who you doing with respect what they do always remember that the above mentioned commandments apply to the forest extends possible to local inhabitants and they do not apply at all to the militant never forget you in origin where there are insurgents against whom you are at war therefore you can never be certain that the person with whom you are speaking is not helping the militant under conditions of guerilla warfare is better to turn down invitation of some one's home and risk offending the host than it is to take advantage of his hospitality and then ing up being an easy catch francer again i think those were just like rules on how to treat other human beings in the world and be successful my head now we get to a linotte axe that i found and this is from so bad i date which is a basically to magazine it's almost like a soldier of fortune magazine and these were some of the some rules for a soldier in a zone of armed conflict fighters can be anywhere posing as peaceful citizens in the day time in changing into killers at night don't accept some one is friendly just because they speak russian and where came a flags clothes his prose my favorite one right here you don't get a second chance and war time never lose the feeling of danger or of the strength the spirit of the russian soldier never leave a base without the commander's permission in the field never touched bright or expensive objects as they may be mine in the mountains whoever is higher is stronger take the high ground on the high grounds gonna take you pay attention the flanks as the basic manoeuvre of the insurgents is to get around to your back and envelop your force always check your flanks in a burned through some of these now these are tactical observations from the gasney combat experience by bret sea jenkinson whose major the u s army you are willing good article or checking out bugle it but i broke down some of these chesson lessons learned this is from the chechense hittin on tactics confused the russian units targeting russian ready operators destroyed rushing commandor small units provided good mobility in wornath basic manoeuvrin hugging which we are to talk about which was staying fifty o two you unedified of the enemy was the most effective way to avoid ereatara morteros or closer support syncronized ambushes confused the enemy to the point that he did not know where to shoot back as a result russian units would start fire fights between themselves strong ledgeville and then each vehicle in between could easily ice late russian arm or comes shooting enemy soldiers in the legs caused snipers to engage other soldiers trying to evacuate the wounded and on leadership gallusly organized unit that allowed greater freedom of action was effective to defend grane little manfredo on the battlefield goes a long way now the russian lesson learned training a preparation of the most important thing in waiting battles erinna training must be longer than days or weeks to be effective urban compartment over must be tailored to fit the enemy situation task organizing de small squad size combined to salt roots of worked better than large units russians under estimated the cheshire to fight lessons learned from successful tactics should be integrated into follow on measures to be successful one must adapt quicker than the enemy feelers respective again as the russians adapted less as onfredo urban battles provide proved invaluable the greatest challenge to leadership was maintaining a moral high casual be rated destroyed the already low moral combat units another challenge to morrow as the russian soldiers fear of enemy mistreatment if captured in this is an important one of failure to justify the nature of russian military intervention in chester resulted in long arrow so the troops on the ground not knowing in onnerstand ing why they were there not understanding a teinturier the vision or their moral bigtime now i have a couple of exerts here from at this is from a unarticled that was in the alley times jinuary thirteenth nineteen ninety five by sonya captured russian soldiers paint bleak picture of chesham conditions so this is drama grassy russia russian troop morals so low conditions are so poor and losses are so heavy that the brush an attempt to take crosses floundering two russian soldiers captured in the capital of the brick waupaca chesties at thursday the sojers are against this war and so our commanders said alexyey year old junior sergeant was called traitee food from an empty also grave after the gong five days without a safe solid meal we are forced to fight the two sogers said russian positions it frequently been bombed by russian war planes many soldiers had been killed by friendly fire from the russian side and constant vehicle break down made it impossible for them to pick up their dead and wounded in this is i i haven't found the book yet i'm sure i will but books that takes you into the barrel on to the ground caus'd been talking all this strategic stuff in ten ridotto that i want to hear from the person on the ground and then this is where you start to get it you start to see what the russians do what the front line troopers were thinking and what it was like for them and here you had him seeing that many soldiers have been killed by friendly fire from the russian side constant vihara down met to impossible from the pick up their dead and wounded in a company that had a hundred men now their only fifty left in our batalion out of free undred and fifty men over two hundred and fifty had been killed the soldiers accounts indicate that the new official figures bring the russian military death to let three hundred ninety four soldiers are vastly understated cassan sources put the russian castetis at about three thousand dead these russians are worse than fashious said grigory amir now fifty years beloved church rows decapitated by the rocket for young guys have been killed in austria they want fighters they weren't against any one i apologized for what rushes doing her hernosand i'm a barrister my country in front of the old world a month after president force yields and promised the russian public that land order would be restored in castnia and that the elegantes and gray would quickly be disarmed it was unclear whether russian forces could soon break through the fierce cheshires istante i don't think they can take the city said one chechini can destroy it but they can't capture it but two russian prisoners who enter draws me on december twentieth looked exhausted filthy and frightened if there condition is typical the rest of the enemy it is not surprising that the russians of not yet attempted to another all out of infantry a soul on drawn frankly there is no discipline no anything in the military now the prisoner said the soldiers are weakened they have an washed for a long time they are hungry and unshaven even a soldier when he wants describe all bad things of god he says that the soldiers are dirty hungry and unshaven there were times were more of us were getting killed by our own people than by the chechens we don't even have time to pick up or dead just no time where eating fighting the cheston all or on airforce bombing us the prisoner added that they'd been ordered to kill everybody from kids to old people not just cashing but also russians so night man the two soldiers said they went to a house northeasterly for food because they had not a proper meal for five days they've been surviving on dry rash and that were never enough and would deliver to their paspiration irregularly as the prisoner spoke chassinis gather around them to listen upon hearing the russians admit that they had broken to the house one man shouted angrily luters oh we wanted with something to eat muttered the prisoner now we got to remember we've got up you know this is that this is the sovietists so they have their own meeta and i found this article an i should be laughing cause it's it's it's horrible but this is the moscow time talking about the other story of crossna city grasses cold and dirty again this is some kind of the state approved message there is no water no lectricity at night the streets or luminate only by distant fire spark by russian shelling and a occasional flares peris full of sound constantly pumping of our tory shells a screams of gravities and the crackle machinegun fire the only source of heat in the burned out baseness of grass the air from all made furnaces that russian soldiers at fashioned from breaks of destroyed buildings at night officers and soldiers hollond them their faces dirty and covered with sweat and there really have water with which to wash it in almost looks like they are wearing the kind of camouflage paint that is the issued to soldiers in western armies these men are by and large normal decent people they believe that they are doing their duty and gestalt le bit contrary to a western from the prisoners a course now the prisoners those guys were in the dress situation tipster might get their heads chopped off at any moment so then probably making the case the best they can that hey you know he upperton stay alive they insisted back article a insisted you not intentionally attack peaceful sevillians ponerant ad waging battle against an organized and pitiless enemy the conscripts were risking their lives in chesham's well be considered a following tears is the paper say that these poor guys that are fighting they speak in siderate even other conscripts that been forced to fight that they might as well be considered volunteers russias not declared a war or martial law so nothing threatens deserved ers except the moral condemnation of the comrades they leave the eye the armies moral has been distantly improving as it becomes more experienced in street fight again there's countless documented cases of the moral impley falling upon and being one of the premier causes of the loss of the battle its casualty rate is falling and is able to inflict increasing punishment on the chastanier the military is confident of victory among these soldiers you here a different opinion about the war than what you read in moscow many reports in a media about cashaca paign or obviously biased against the military some maiden be censored when i was in chessmen to january twenty second a crew from rushing television was in granehorn report for the evening news program the reporter graphic footage of the bodies of russian soldiers who had been mutilated by the chassis however the host of the programmer fused to error without even seeing it of course only a fraction of the russian armies fighting in chechnya but they have been sent here there from virtue every military district in the country eventually they were turned to their bases and tell their stories to the rest of their comrades in arms and those soldiers will put a lot more stock in what the chesson cheshire erin's haf to say than they will in any press reports or human right active esso there is the ah the official russian version ruglin your experence that i the happen here like you too your stuff in the media in your life than that that's not ohiei tely happens here do no doubt about i am the way that the media portrays things is is a very wrong you know often very wrong i think one of the class is that i've been telling lately or talking about lately is that they the never portray the iraqi people as noble human being is that just one to live normal lives they never portray the araceae like that when that's what they are neathermost majority of iraqi people are normal people that one to have a job raise their kids is what they gits goin to school and prove a lives do better that's what the vast majority of iraqi people who want but you know when when last time you saw an american family on the news that was going to the store to a grocery shopping then come home and an dusommerard the afternoon and no no that don't show that because it's not new tetigisse thing in iraq they don't show that you so we always get the impression that you know that every one iraqis some kind of meliant raworth dtired of us being hard as not true not true at all he such a one of the biggest points i can think of with a mediatised to they just get it wrong yea they just get it wrong and it really leaves people in america thinking was god why are we there ye it's so crazy that he do we you know why they don't want us here no actual they do want a thereon' show those people you show the processes hocus that's noon since i it's not news to you to you some one that suessetani americans or old for the can maintain a piece that's not news isn't that crazy hell all it sure that's not news and that an they kind of make sense you don't what er you why would you report on an american family do you know the dead went to work you reporting that cause not beaneries sense but the fact that you are not reporting every day stuff is the sentially changing the the accurate message into message that inaccurate then that's something you know there the it is you is it a go it's horrible to moves this is just another little section the russian counter in surgeons operation in cashear one a winning the battle losing the war by mathew in janko arp g and naperies focus to on exposed russian troops small groups of ten to twenty cessings moved it down a buildings and the surrounding mountains to gage have we armed and armor russian troops the chestiness were to tack in the ships some attacking while the others rested so a force of no more than fifty helenore battalions at bay bottled neck in the narrow streets and cities or the treffle thaler the treacherous defiles of the mountains the chesselton of information and space and the highly sophisticated networking allow them a tremendous advantage in terms of physical combat and even more important vantage in terms of psychological impact on their enemy rather than a group of rag tag and surgeon fighters few of my hatred and national fanaticism the cusinier were highly trained disappointed well equipped and knowledgeable of the terran from the individual obtuse army level a chassons held the advantage in all but a power and fire support and we are to talk about how they overcame that the chasing fighters proved better trained equipped technically skilled and fed and demonstrated remarkably higher moral and motivation in addition to an intimate knowledge of the hazira such an cisinil how over and over again they point out on both sides how big the factor moralism so if you're no leadership position whether you're working with a team he there were from the company with you thickening a with a business mulehaus important and you have to pay attention to it yet it seems that canadian or something it seems like moralis kind of this extra thing you know oh what you don't feel good ruinousness business you know you don't feel good about it but an that's that's kind of a few will you not have the futility i wouldn't say a few itasse fire until a right fires seen the first chessar cashing fighters many of them former soviet soldiers with combat experience in afghanistan and bulging to the hills and found a defensive and fierce war of attrition with the russian troops not on like their former after any count of parts although both sides engaged in acts of brutality to weaken the enemies are resolved to fight cashing fighters fall out did the russian counterparts in these criswell back they hung russian wounded upside down wounded and dead upside down on the windows of defense positions for example forcing the russians to fire at their combat comrades in order to engage the rebels clearly at the second time we saw about that clearly that had a huge in back i can't even imagine what that does to you psychologically when you want to shoot at the enemy and you got to shoot at one o your brother or mill osier wounded i mean he might be dead by possibly just wounded her and either way he's very there you got a shot yet both russian and chasing down were rotundly boitard by the chastens cruchotine insight into the likely actions reactions of rabiosa soldiers we are to tarautas in addition chassinis used dirty tactics collectively learned from dozens of a symmetria conflict before such as instructing snipers to aim for the legs of russian troops injuring but noting capacity them in the shooting free range of the subsequent rescue parties that were sure to come some snipers aimed specifically at the growing dealing a crippling and militating wound and a humility humiliating wound that resulted in the slow painful death and we we experiences and iraqi where a part of it was i ruiller people tell man the the cause there was a irreligiosi on it was a sniper the shots colegiata in the going and then you do one person got shot a growing and in remote and i shall remember it on thinking all the goethale logical it is atiologische attack cestons routinely dressed and rushing uniforms to dan access to bases and used these opportunities to want a surprise attack from behind and my lines each chesson took seriously the notion that the center of graving the war was no longer the enemy's army but rather the enemy's people tactics were devised to attack the psyche of the russian name be creating a constant level high level of psychological stress on the russian servicemen to undermine the moral so the chassis were attacking the moral attacking them doing things that weren't attacking them psychologically hard by united sense of purpose in driving out the invader the cessions terrified and tarried the russian troops slowly bleeding out their around willingness to fight the russian troops many still in their teens were woefully unprepared and under trained in comparison the result of such a disparity in the low and military expectations had tragic consequences according to one russian pertestin the men on the ground shaking and angered by their losses were just taking it out on any one they found there was revenge in the air for those comrades who had been killed and now you end up with serestus gets so frustrated their so psychologically damage at their going out and taking out on the local cashing of which are some of these russians some of these people are a good russians and there taking out on them that taken down on englaenderin and now what happens now every one starts turning against you as a nightmare without recourse to set peace conventional battle the chastiser and sad argument ly arguably achieved the acme of skill by subduing their enemy largely before the fighting began at the same time the russians with their vast superiority in military fire power failed to use it use it to tactical and curtii advantage by employing air and space power thoughtlessly or unimaginably a russian power was less effective or even disastrously impotent so lack of imagination lack of creativity brutal brutal war and a lot of lessons learned ananta that there is a lot of lessons that were learned by those russians on the ground that were absolutely implemented by american forces in i know in remote absolutely the amount of similarities for that urban combat and the things that we watched out for because of the sacrifices made by the russian soldiers i say that eugen back and am glad that we were able to take away some lessons and take those to the battle field in remote and do things like protect the local populace and do things like understand there their culture and do things like not take out are gresson on the local populace which only turns the local populace against you and it was that professionalism of the u s military of the u s army soldiers of the u s marines that professionalism to maintain that discipline throughout the battle thou act absolutely crick in bringing about the victory it's crazy all these um u les m strategies and in an tactics are it's all the same the paten book like all the books of these messages are its all the same it's crazy it is it is it is all the same it is crazy how some one of they are and when they discometer line up and again it amazing how that the tactics from the battle field ragleth tactics in business and reflect the tactics in the human life yet whitton would kinda erfuellen but is one you talked about the the chastening um rebels that they there were the revels raison cucinante how they attacked the russian moral brissot given ireful is that we you can't with like um gushue their girlfriend or the wife that's what they do attack their more out yes yes lewaige me that feeling but it's like the encoorage you that ferry feeling because you onderstand how detestate as you know and it's not in exactly yeah that's perfect way to put it because it's not the thing where it's different than chopping off the guys heads and putting it at you know on on stakes that that's something for sabattier ent it's on this weird like kencote it level but still so devastating so it's weird words it's it's panic bad when you you see a die doing that to lie to a girl also is horrible and also and you mention the relier the moral piece is something that gets to nor to so often especially in the business world where me boldest their moral will take a beating the markets bat all these things and if you don't propatorohn protect them rouse you don't defend them round you don't strengthen them row that's when you could what what what happened to the russian soldiers numeral fell apart he yet in a lot of times them if the moral is don't like in a company or something the leader he's bad he'll kind o blame them like you guys have bad attitudes you don't we trying to do some business here and you don't have a bet attitudes but it you know you that's a golthoth pleader is not taking onereuse situation is why ownership is so un portant because the man it you start belaying ominous ears but in aloof and when you start blaming people for bad moral you know the if the the the beatings will continue until moralities doesn work e you know the beating is do not prove morello you say can off the top you had with you say that that's more common than not that just that whole thing where you now just a blame people in general i isolated absolutely i mean it it is absolutely a a very common problem in leadership ah that's that's why our book is done really well because people say all men yes i do that i i can't believe i do that you have used never hear any of this stuff i growing up let you say okay don't blame by it's a it's not like a bull strong message that you're sent growing up i know i wasn't i don't think to that people have iceolation focused on ownership at this level i think that's why that i think that's why the book is done very well yet i think that's why people continue to contact me in say a that you guys think you for in this book it changed when i look at everything if change the way i've done my business it's changed the way i'm treating my wife he changed my family of changed my outlook on my physical failings hum so so when you take ownership to that high level and that intensity and you called extreme undersomething to figure as a huge in fact i think what that we are the first people that have said to know what this needs to be the focus this is the game changedhis is the fundamental principle in life that is going to charm you from failure to success is not when you say he this person didn't help me in this person when against me in this person savatinga great but doesn't matter well you take ownership of everything some esatti me i got it own it i got for you how to stop ye and it's the son when you when you cut know that or you kind of get wind o that it almost seems so ogier well well i think in if i'm goin to blame some one no of course they're going to blame me back if i if i get belligerent toward an locate a new believe but you don't you and your knew that really if you're asked but it's all it's hollie you don't think if i take ownership and what else is going to tear start taking oneship it you know you don't really think about that that much even though after you know it it seems real obvious the things are simple but not easy when at ease they really are and ownership when you take on hership o problems or you take ownership of your life and when you don't have any body else to blame they hurt ye ethers are the ego where the mind it hurts so people even though it's really easy anita on everything it's hard to do it's difficult for people to do and when they do do it we may do step across that line and they do take orders of the absolutely seethings turn round and i i've heard that you i mean thankfully for the internet thankfully for twitter and face book and all these things people hit me up every single day an say either hay this change my life or some into just something mine you know they say that some issues at work to day took ownership over the album solved in netley did stray what would that person that done a bumping before they read the book it would blame somebody out that would shift to the problem it you know her they would have they would have ignored it they would have cast blame some or else they wouldn't solve the problem so when you take on her ship in a lousou that then solverat so that's the getae so now it is time for question said from the inter web ye we are all have a current event question which technically is that rapine well i would say it's not i i'll explain why it's not a current event once you asked for question ran cause it's so it is but i what are your thoughts on the onomea verses a deast and the holly home persis mishtake fight that you as it's one ninety six is fast weekend women's bent to wait championship on the home prisme should take and then a s like a super fight right yer superfine aias in an otamage was a chap at one forty five be and here's why this is not a canivet question to me because this is just a question about fighting he really is because and you could say this at any time these were good examples on we talked about these examples in one year five years in there's other fights that are similar examples hollyhocks checkbook and boxer though he and a very good mixmaster however not that great jug not not horrible not trying to bag on her because she is awesome meanright or to the spot with a great coach trattore she lost her me she take who is definitely not as good of a striker but who is better on the ground yet and she's real real well round his noane round it yes she's extremely well rounded and she's also gotten beat a twice by rondeaus and the the strategy in those fights that she ad was awful in the misstatement of the via for some reason be shot kept clenching and grabbing and trying to take the fight to the ground again ronda which was just superciliary a better strike her so i don't know i think that might change the next time they fight in these show woefully i have a smaller game plan then trying to grapple with ronda there's no reason for it tattersett advantage of it fell on the other hand with pollywods does get the grappling going yes and that not easy you know along it avoiding the take ousanoletah so good um but ye finally does it in the in the fires he had her in at the end of the act round there yes but you know penitentiary out um and then he managed to edwin the fifth round managed to get it to the ground and immediately finished yea i mean she managed and that keaou said that she managed to like to get it to the ground because it was rugufu take down this thing she got it on a fine leg she'd gotten stuffed a couple o times it was holly was done a really good job of keeping a bay and holly was obviously scarce even the second and she got once it was on the ground of his he domination by besa in then the holy didn't want to go to the ground with her again but then she let her get in and then like you said meeus force that thin and of drag it in all ugly way is gonna make it it has a ground and want you or gontanille got a back an then when she got back she got choking once got the chokin ally kinetotele off when you and even that was a little bit mistake of hollywood just like studenthood off yer like a really good despeate judgin to player might do but she didn't she flipped her over and landonniere the choking enfantines meshes been some soap before she is a scrappy though she got bigheart she fights of water heard i gave her i gave her some props i mean so to hollyford mean ally would sleep she even cap you shows like what no i'm not tapping you and you could see her instinctively started throwing the elegantine at the end i mean into the air in the different direction because that's her that's her training goes to a ayestreehood see that all the time you can essenced up everythin goes get not even a star grappling on what it with her i foreswore with the rat or suelonius kind of un unconsciously doing it no kind of it's kind of compliment elise you know the other skill like that's all automatic has so long emotions she does you sloping at the air of even though she's in a sleep i so yes so in this case straight up yeditor right he societal about to give us a deep refund the mc gregor des fight see the hole i think it was there is a lation i think to that i think i i think that the degrees the outlook one happened to what i just elkanah they they fought they fight at one seventy and nadasti one fifty five or i think sometimes he shot his part on aistheseon seventy before ye me but but he's his normal weight for fighting is one fifty fiorito mc gregors normal way for fighting is one for nine and came up ten pounds but due to the late nature of the de bow day adele undered up finding out one seventy yet so they fight in an itsel ttle battle and i think from what i saw it as it was close but i think connomore caught him like some said one connop old ones an den yo and in um then yet shifted and the name thirty catching him and jarniman and and i think that's really what did it because he he started beating off and then canerent for a take down and that's what you typically what you do when when you go for to take down to the way he did that's when you get beat up and you go for their clinch you know that's a void getting beat up the even in boxing they do that you know you can be that you go for the count so the old kind of what that kind of was and in emmaus you go for the take down this kind of war is so he did but and not so thing that here comes a judicatories so the reality is caramanico dn't you that wasn't an option for him where it sure he went for the taken but bonita down is even worse now because my dears is one of those you do really good you just to get a really good so and on a gregory still working on his jugs good from what i hear what i but not like a des natives like levels above him absolute to the ground and it really showed so not only is contarino beat up a little bit and indeed now he's on the grand seduction which is that's a atulla double strike him so of course he gone takes a couple of marshes and then nat joked them apetite yobina oski and in one thing the dears was point out to week when he were getting interview in everything he says it you know he eyed better turnours in you tell go on romestan look he is wonastow his brother neck he will with j shields who is a beast on the ground i mean he's wrong with all those little bad as wrestlers too you've got one yea o got cronies gayer getting after it you don't i mean it in so ah who i mean i don't know i mean he traded with gonorrhoea with gonorrhea going to one's good everything but this but the thing is about the jugi went about the training the guisado training with all the time that's the guitar you turned with every day that's what makes you good at the guy that comes out for a two week camp or a full week amphorae that does not make you good at you gito and i shared one or two things for it's not the life rats not the deep daily grind with the with the masters you know that's what made you really good if so i think that like i said i mean it's it's definitely showed that you did so definitely works a tin also shoes you how hard it is to get good at how much harder is to get good at as her me misha no she was not dominating but she was surviving on the stand up you know what i mean and his own old claus strike her she is she's definitely a better striker then we should take is a grappler i mean mishtake doesn't have any tremendous acolytes as a grappler she's a high level amimadab over she's not a world champion grape and yet you know she was able to hang because striking his up for the most part from a far perspective is a liner fouatter love throwing strikes in other human grappling as with infinitely more complex infinitely it infinitely more complex and so you have to learn it earlier and if you want to i me make something of it i can striking striking as an element of luck to it he adn't care what you say i striking as i mean when out when two emilies go in the cage there is not a god as his hay i i can definitely knock this guy out there is absolute lockers you know knockout there are so to even in boxing if where the robert is a punch of the guy they had knock em out where as a rear nakacho is a reinecke you i like you you know it's a renegade it is a very very a sure weapon do you teizing in those situations immantinente or her grace i just made a real small short comparison to it he was boxing he said the average first thing can walk into a bucking jim in and racoon and knock made use o what he and rock soon if he just slings for the fence and right and and that is possible but you git on you can't really do that get really a new giacome in as the white belting real hard and ussome how catch someone yea and in an wortheton to ye and i once you learn that you and the other guy doesn't know it and he hasn't learned or hasn't learned it even close to to how much you've learned it it's that it's that easy really it's the in really the the best way to say it is you have that much control over the flight you do now to the fingers i don't want a make like all of a sudden duette is the all powerful thing because you can't discount the the dozens and dozens and dozens of jujitsu people that have been beaten emanative and beaten down they've been knocked out the thiohero stuffed so there there's no doubt about that but it it it is definitely the skill that you have to have enhiding for maxara arch for sure i mean without it you know you could be without it which have as you have seen one and you have see to run did you do just beach the other martial arch weather dressing with his boxing doesn't matter you know but you do have to train everything in me i anjitsu take the longest to learn there's the most larnce old start with it i can at a box cannot rustle you knock out a no more tie um and that's the way it is yet in line have that much of the discrepancy between like a certain element of of people's game like in and i think you giunto be the more prevalent because a lot of times people people be like all walls certain guys like let's say like a chocolate or clawed their like have yes aren't what actually will just say chuck adolphe's not necessarily digestible belt and you chaminade but the thing is he he had rustling back round so he had grappling but her ill he knew about giafer sure or leaving me out like where the amber comes from where the choke come from how to defend the choke and the onoto all these things so knowing did get to san like you need to know jugeaient necessarily mean you got to be a black belt in judicher you have to have this slick as sharpest submission necessarily you just have to know juditious don't know it or no very little he i'd say the chances of you getting exposed exposed is really high there i agree with nithing these just so happen last night um that that the those fights exemplified that i agree with you codicote gigito as i was listening to your recent potash ught that of a few topics you could discuss that would be good and help for your young eyes wanted join the military and go special i know that bud and other training are just baseline and treat level schools but in my experience those stories are walkitis in fire up so you know god wants to hear about bud storin what it's like going through those stories throughout those sieves of training because it gets people excited an fired up well there's there's actually kind of a reason why i don't said around and talk about but which is basic heel basic onward dealers in soldering three natanson than talk about it a bunch uh one of those reasons is because but is not the iltis at all and it doesn't mean anything and i try and say that isn't often as i can be getanittowit the impression that that the seal team is the little initial training that is barely even a fraction of your career in the helotes and has nothing to do with what you actually do when you get in this heeltaps i also don't want and this is an intentional is is more a response to a question but i don't tell stories to get guys fired up to join the military about buds because that isn't what the sicans is that's not what an asset odit mas that's not well rangabean as ranger battalion as satis not the selection course to that you go through to get into that that's not what the job is and you shouldn't be joining the military ancient be trying to give in the special operations because you wanted do that training you should do the training cause you wanted do the job you want to do the actual job of being in special operations and being special forces in being the rangers in being in marocain in the sealinata do that job and if you want it do that job what it really boils down through a running or rocking or pull up ter swimming or any that craft at boils down to whether you have the two wills that i talk about that wire is determined by and that is the will to kill because that is the entire premise of your job if you are in the military and all you may be somehow supporting that if you're in the military but the ultimate goal of the military is to kill the bad guise and if you're going to be in special operations you're going to be all mutimer of that so you absolutely after make sure that you have the will to kill and you also obviously if you're going to join special operations or you want to be in the sialam you have to have the will to die not that you wanted die not that you want to be a morter not that your freckening like that but you absolutely have to make sure that you have the willingness to die and i would say put your life in the wine but no one going beyond that i'm talking about the willingness die because if you join special operations or you join this soltys or you join any of the combat arms in the army or the morincourt you will be asked to put your life on the line and you got be ready said do that you've got to have that will you got to be ready to make that commitment and i mean the training in you if you have that will to kill you have that will to die the training runesten to ropiest all that stuff is the easy part in so if you're sitting there and you see see you will training on van you think oh that be cool don't think about that as what being to see yo'll is because it is not that is just the selection is just the weeding out of the week you want to be a seal manyouema no mean you want to go in the harms away i mean you on a metonomy on the field of battle that's what being a seal is an that's why i really don't said around and tell bud stories propiante much more to say about that one i'm sure at some point i go i mean there's funny things that happened in bodandigo course but this comparable what happens in a sea portunatus no ideal yes yes tentereng like you put it to foldin' do it because you want to go through trained it it is you on to do the joy is an it's a big dutch a big mistake maybe i can help some people out that are out the right now sikandra like to go through that training no don't do it to go through the training go it do it because you want to do that job you is it true the the they take a pin and they stick it in your skin and clip it opened on you skin the relation when when you get your trident yet dedit as like three little prongs that go out the back of it to stick it on to your uniform and when you get your trinity a put it like indoor skin young the sick you standing out with no shirt near life orleanian in it and in a neneter body when i went in i got my trifolatia lined up and every one punchit matches until you just believe everywhere a big bruise on your just austin next question do you have experience with people telling you that your two intense or that i need to work on not being so up front and straight forward sometimes it's called working on your how i think it would be great to hear how you could apply this using extreme oneship in the business world there is a big plush on diversity which is wonderful but often it comes with also deever ifying away from intensity and male abrasion core i'd love your thoughts well this is tysander sting to it this question kind of strange consecution because all the time when i talk about we worship i talk about how often do you hear me say take the indirect approach to something hum the air i always talk about the indirect approach because the direct approach is is not du git the direct approach is beating our head and punching someone in the face so i always talking about using the indirect aproach so bits very nature in direct is not straight forward it eats not in ten peso no i don't have people telling me on to an tens ron to straightforward why don't i have em told me not because i'm not i'm not and i'm not saying that i'm not in tenent saying that i'm not straight forward by a very very careful not to go too far with either this is this is like a fighter that owing to hard or being to predicable just will stand and trade and take damage and do damage that's the direct approach the direct approach is i punch you in the face and you punch me in the face and we play a war of a triton i don't want to enter into a war of a treasure i do not want to enter into or patrician i want to use a moderator i won't to move i want to slip unseen into the weak areas and the set my bombs and have them go off so i just got this assisting by a relatively new clitofis you don't argue betoken their faces and and didn't official deshi and count straight up the day need to get their active you could see that this person was very excited by that idea it was osiers an ye it was that you had this idea there so come in and just give their faces an tell mos screwed up they were and i said no i i likely will not do that and then i said to my slocket told you that you were all screwed up in your failure your job than you do your weak leader what would you then be feel like you really wanted to listen to me would you would you be open to my suggestions of that point do you think i'd be an efficient coach do you think i would even appear as an intelligent human being if the best i could do to coach you with the tell you that you sucked as a leader and you are a failure your job and your schooling everything up then i see the answers were no no no of course not i would be a horrible co i would be on hollible leader myself if that's what i resorted to and most importantly if i want you to change and the way i'm trying to get you to train his by the change is by being abusive and begging you to send up your defences than nuclite to me we how good my doing why would i do anything that's going to any habit my goal which my goes to get you to change did you to be a better leader so if i slap you in the face with a grecian oh straight forwardness that makes you defensive how does that help me the enters it doesn't stop again that doesn't mean that i'm never straightforward that i'm never aggressive but i count killeth moments i canute those omans to there is a reason why we sugarcoating for a little children right veris why is it so they take it it's so they take it into their system and it's the thing thing with the dull heavy besant sugar coat i don't you don't just tell me how it is they don't mean it you they want it sugar coated because they want to accept the into their body it's just like you giunse you do do need to set things up you need them manipulate the kept people to do what you want to do especially or has to do with them changing themselves one of the worst way to get some one to change his by telling him exactly how you want them to change i mean of course there situation we have this beautiful latinship and you bottome one you have to intimate coastwise another human being i don't think i have that way to any body but there have been situations in my life where i've had oh just complete under trust with you know maybe there's three or four people that i have that with in my whole life that i can just say listen that here's the deal don't get defensive here's what's going on here which in ye do it just the very few people do you have that relationship in life so he got to youse that newman that monovar fare and it's the same thing with the grassiest thing that this willisen in this article don't yell at the gesindel you're not going to be able to get what you want from them and like i said it doesn't just apply to those people apply as the all people you got a bring people win and you got em and nicolete them and i know that gain that has negative connotations but it's what you're doing your trying to get some one to think a different way that's many uation i call it influence and call whenever you want but that's what you're trying to do and the most difficult way to manipulate some one as to slap them in the face with a gresson so there is a little bit conomy here of course because you know i was say the default mode asked to be aggressive but i don't mean necessarily overtly aggressive it means that you are aggressively forcing things to go in your rection through every means necessary through over cover in clandestine and honestly the preferred method of all this cover the preferred method for me to get ached something different is for echoed never even think i had an opinion on it is for me just as i sanitated enemy lines plant the seeds and let him grow and let echo come to conclusion that you're going to change your way or doing something of you don up to think differently about something that lidyship that's real leadership so that's what you got a work if somebody is telling you your two intense and you to aggressive guess what you are you're giving away your greatest weapon your advertising your attack surprise is one of the most key components in a battle and when you tell people aggressively and overtly what your doing your giving up that element don't do it i'm asking you not to be manipulative person behind the scenes with weird plans that is what i'm asking you to do that is what i'm asking to do because that is how you get things done as how you get into people's minds that is how you will lead not by yelling not by being overly aggressive not by being so intense that people don't want to listen to you get intensities a form of emotion right and the many you come across as in emotional intense maniac people are questioning already your validity this gusto intense hum don't be that guy when nipple influence be clandestine and cover and that is how you in the reason that is kind o laughing omatsurie question is that it can a makes sense from some one's kind from outside and the only in the mean time on me personally were out view you as being intense or aggressive or or is like when you're just talking about something that you you never do in it towards anybody now like you'll never lose it i've never then i've known you since oh six i think some like that yes um an i'm never seen you lose your temper get mad i mean kind of ill one time on but this agitating to lay about it at we never really see you get mad but may be wanted two times an you have this aggressive and intense personal at first sir and when you talk about things for sure but yet when you're dealing with people it's it's real thank basically the way you'd want to be engaged now another human yeh yeh yeh annecians to have somebody get aggressive with him it's never it never the only time at once like if your home doing a prisoner like a literally if i'm handling a prisoner i'll be aggressive with them ill if i'm trying to get command of a of a of a chaotic situation and there's a there is another aggressor in the situation i might have to be more aggressive than that person but any normal situation do when human beings agression isn't a attribute it's a negative because all it does is make people defensive fenelon it it doesn't mean that you're seating back in your shirking and and shrivelling up we put it it means that your finding that bhowanee with another person and your your working with them and conversing with them to bring them along into your way of thinking yet that's what it is in in you know when somebody asked me a question like this it really signifies to me that i makes me nervous because i think to myself i see this all the time i mean i say use the indirect approach don't you know get people's defences up i say this all the time and yet some one can still come back and say you know people are telling me on being too gratifie venitian ownership with the fact that there being few grander right it's like the all verole morrell week ye ye and therefore since there week they think on to aggressive i can't believe how pathetically are ye that's the reality that's what is going through some of my this mind like sometimes it's called working on your how you know he's kind of saying oh there they lay got a you for is in fordin in the business will there's a big push under verity but it comes with the first of flying away from intensity and malagueta i mean you can guarantee you what what this this gatoua goin to say like no you've got your state of pathionately can't take it you've got cushamon actually its complete wrong answer ye if people can't take it it's because you are being to a great a the way you're giving it is wrong that way you're being in a iron you know so that aggression needs to be shamed in such a way that it's been utilized to further the goal a fertile and you know who you get aggressive less yourself you get agressive with it yourself that's what i get aggressive west you am straight for a wet i'm straight forward with my self that's hemstret forward i am the one guy that i am allowed to get aggressive west to be shrieked with to put things into not sugar coat anything i'm allowed to do that with me bemoiled to wit with another human because it's not in effective way of leadership it just is not yet it's a it funny out like it that is litanist and with you what i said is is absolute uninten i've ever seen you give mad at someone else but at the saying at fame time and i pick a lot of people who may not know you good but but have have experienced being around you they all so i would say that they all feel the same way and that is that you have look in jack's cooler whatever but if he were to like lose his cambron me he paroly die yea good god is and the right if like i'm not a not losing my temporalities be good at all yet that'd be bad i have you know that would not be good since if he has saaaaaaay cagey though right that is that i conoscete yet the sense of impending doom is there at the same time very and and and i think it i think it does genuinely surprised people yes because i look like a serial killer all of big guy whatever and they expect that down on to be aggressive in implementing this and how you got to get your ship together i put it just not it just an effective way of leadership of that was if that was leadership leadshire easy it would be easy right oester one had a what i said you know yes i'm just going a yell at every one and then they'll do what i say that just does not warn yes crazy look causes the way you talk a lot of the times not alatau just the way it may be it's like deshistan out an out your voice ought eupori really is you do sound intense even though you're not being intense you know you just kind of seem that way for all these reasons of morality you seder when i'm talking about something that i care about ray as i am definitely going to be intense about it especially when it's something that is impact to me yet and and something that means something to me and ticket me leader to do me a lot to me yes and and trying to help people lead isn't important thing to me i enjoy it and i like to see people succeed so therefore when i talk about it sometimes i get a little bit fired up and i get intense with what i'm saying that isn't scary that disco's like indirectly scary so it's not let mansard you kit i'll just all you ward scary indirectly very work when you do a psychism not scared what you doing but you kind of kinema in you like a bright what a you know don't you kinda like you like this raging her came that when it comes by it turns into like the warm gentle pris you have in that he got like and maybe that's a that's probably part of the advantage yea heard of the advantages people the eye i said this i think it was temperate the two you'll people are surprised when i can sit there and have a conversation with them and i am not aggressive with them and my mind is open to what they're saying you that's part of the game he next quest oajaca your action to marcomir arthur lucie forming marine course special operations command yet so that the new the new moving oh so inside question that his asking so marines think built their seals now or yes we should be or we should have been marines all along so this is a question about like i said the marine course special operations command or was a formed in no dodoland five two thousand six may be um in an if you don't know the army has its own special operations grew the navy has its own special operations group the air force as its own special operations group and the marine court did not slay what is force reconnoiter yet or suportin was a part of the marine corbitant broken off and an didn't get the extra money in the extra funny and it didn't fall into the chain a command of special operations is and so when they made more so it did so now they took a bunch the fore recount eyes and putting into a group and have their own funding and everything else so the bottom line is on this it is that the marine corals and i love the marine corps and i think that this was long over due i think that the marine corps as a whole is likely it's likely the most capable of fighting unit the world is ever known to be honest with you i mean maybe the in addition the air bone divisions from the army are also just highly capable but that the marine corn with its air ground sea is a commanding controls cat integrated intelligence it scot everything and i can use it all together and solet make hugest not extremely effective and efficient fighting force and there highly disciplined there highly motivated there's a credible a predator so for me this will long over to and i think that i actually did a turnover with the with the initial kind of mar sock grew in two thousand and four bataan i work with them require on i had more work with force recoton multiple deployments when i was a younger seal and they took a bunch of those guys of bunch of just legendary for recondite and put him into the first maracapana and they were awesome also mortiers awesome guys and i to actually have a one thing that lethe benefit to them as in the rincon or in the marine course so every marinore marine as riflemen they have the opportune to work with big conventional infantry companies and platoons and italian so so there dies will be very experienced and i think that they are going to be i mean i think that the more marine corspe ial operations command is going to be an extremely capable force in the future and i am glad to say the least that they will be defending a country and freedom around the world for many many years to go yet i can ages long with what are you re sara lot of these points that these books may about how the discipline in the training or so paramount you know in success now you have yet another division that's gonna get some solid training in all their affertur there's no doubt the rincona put these guys through outstanding draney ye not estion do you consider shooting a martial art and how his your fire arm was training been like or unlike marshalled training tell shooting is absolutely a marshal art is i mean may be now the way people picture martialis nowadays be old because when you picture martial are evil picture you know a guy with a geaving carathis this right at the generator come that's not that's not martial art actually to me marshal arts is the art of war the ardor in individual old worry your skills that it takes and firearms lutely martial art because it's something that you train it something that you get good at it's something that you need to maintain your skill at and it is absolutely a marshal art into me it's another piece of a puzzle to nother thing that you should you need to know how to do and just like tactics that go along with shooting or an important part of being a warrior you need not issue in the training is very similar in my mind to martial or straining in that it takes you know repetition you have to know what the basics are you after repeat those basics and then you get more advanced and it's it's about movement in getting efficient with your movement in then you want to train it very similar to the way that you train mixed martial arts or martial argenta matters you know you're goin to have different threat levels now you got to deal with them and you want to deal with you weak side you know you scan you shoot with your off hand in various environments in the lolighet in the dark end of rain and the you want to mix it up through your used to all that you want to be used to people at close range you want i be used to people and farther range in an once you get all those my canial skills down and you want to train your mind around this thing you want to train your mind around this skill so that your mind now how to you elise this skill when things are unexpected in when there is chaos and when there is mahamego on an us that's one of the things that i really like about the same munition training or paint poltroni or lasertag training is it allows you you know as you to have somebody else back at you he put witches just like you know just like rolling and jugernath or sparing him i may is you after react you the person no longer just a cut up it no longer to shooting paper targets that don't you back and don't move um so you so i love to take it once you've got the skills down and then you learn it got the fundamentals down an you take the advanced fundamentals and then you begin to train dissimulate combat and it is all tell you i had these um i got these later tag guns hum for my son i just got two of them at first but that as elated very chickicoue they were also there a leslie nerve later tag ones and you could shoot each other at i don't know maybe a hundred meters which is a pretty good shot and as i a pistol and so when i got these in seems i got two of em and i realized how good they were i thought though more so i could go against my son and his friends and they could go against each other and i taught my son like all the basic military manuvres that he would need to know and this is what he was maybe eight years old in and she we would play this game all the time you know and so i count him out of coverlet it out get elevated positions i taught him how to do enviarme technique where you don't show your face at the same spot like twice a rower time you get up you move a little bit and he realized that that's how you win in his little games and the real was the real tactics is in so i had a speakin speaking of speaking of the rincon i had a friend that i was was came over house one time and he was you know of a marine and we got in the conversation all of a sudden you know my son comes out with the later tag guns and my son's like oh you know do want to go in the eyes like a yap course let's do it so my son looks at a man as indoor outdoor and all was you could see the or something going on in the guy goes out door outdoor so my son you be pressed the button on the thing in a countdown for ten seconds and then it's on soyland cover as the delatioun seconds my son had the thing my son takes off at the door sill watching the gundahar scared because you know you you're going against a train her to an became now the guy comes out and and it dark right the guy comes out of the door and on watching me can crouched a little bit and always on his gun because it all in this incessitates place inside the gun you don't wear a help it you don't hear anything you actually are shooting the other person's gunson shot when he when i get shot a gooseherd shakes in the red light fighting so he walks out and sereno my son had run around the block down in all any position and as soon as he came walking out of my son sort of drilling him he and the gustiness in rising he freezes he doesn't even think to myself all take cover no he just froze and got drill and then as soon as it's easychairs kind of looking around looking around looking on fine mehe sees my son he starts to point the weapon up towards my son my son to disappears if if and then the gusseys trots kind of walking over in that direction and then fifteen seconds they are my son pops upon his flank and drills of magan from behind another offence of the whole the wall anyways and of kinahane in the gashes go get it and my son betmore times interrupted it's because he had the basic the basic skills they seempathetically is an it was you know he would shoot and then move and that's what i potone so that kind of thing is is very important in as far as being a martial art and you should train yes and onion i said this to sam harris when i was on his boast you know gal maybe there's no chance because you live in a in the bubble and you live in a great neighbourhood and your well protecting have a large systemous all that and maybe you're never going to have a problem and that's great i mean there's always a chance i would never believe that you're never got very calm but there's always a chance that somebody is going to commence that evils going to enter your world and you want to be ready for that now if that makes me sound paranoid okay let's do say you are not paranoid and you don't think it's ever going to happen but it is still highly valuable to train in these situations because they make you a better person they make you sharper they make you smarter they make you more prepared if something does happen it's just good to know this stuff and it makes you a better person more liable to real skill set you know i was was kind of bum doubt about basket ball or football or baseball because those are the there tollishill involved in monterist the skill it self of thornaby of shooting a basketball downefall is not as valuable as a skill as number one a marshal artist you know motive boxing wrestling digito because no aureal apple apple cabooli hundred per cent in this same thing was shooting a gun manatis a real applicable skill that you may need it some point your life and uavemi what supplements do you an echo take what's up with mustache well my number one supplement is stated yes beautiful staying that's a number one am well there garagoule things that i take no one i take creolian it every day for probably ten years may be a little bit longer than i and i take gogoniant ken at every day for ten plus years i got i had what my shoulder

i am i you i eat a lot o coconotte oil well whenever i get the chance i like dipping things and coconino cocales oh if you get a taste for and it's a really nice tasting thing yes yes so that's that's the supplements that i take a you know want thing that's been really cool is is picking up or a sponsorship for one from the poast you know from joe a h obviously been a big sportscar the treason that

his company a with on it but what's great is they make good cality stuff and it's real simple yelled fennians and it ever lytell you em about this but if you go be gone i on the whatsyourname you can get stuck on there for a long time just reading all this stuff about it you know like that that coil was one and i knew at croom long tom and there cruallie these little they're like little shrimp in hometon thinger erway so keenly innishmore for lactation but all they get it is like it's all equal friendly where hasn't destroyed the or or affecting ocasion the big ship the vessel that they used to to the harvest to the crill is like lomaine specifically certificate dangers real in debt is stuck on the er interesting to cause they tell you like one of the benefits you don't how do they know that these benefits are there can he can just say hey take this little cure this he can't do do that you got to go through this process to the otisfield aster to crilion know maybe like chevenges ago or something at some point i went from fish oil yelleppet there's summons like little bit little with peters and i think it's a lot better eh when well at least when you read about it but to my people asked me now oh what are you do you know could import four years old the old man rabu i don't feel forty four yet i feel at twenty four you don't feel forty frai feel for i feel twenty four an actually the thing that orichalcum me on the fish oil was there was a guide that was a bad asked eye and he was fifty four but he was a competitive of power left when he was younger and he was really to shape this is probably when i was well where was i then atheisten years ago or something like that i was like betty years old a nicolo young and healthy and i said you know he what do you do like what your main thing to keep you so young and healthy and you said i take fossil every day and okayannie literata yea i will get all board that train is so yet to be asked me for some toand no no chill will get you some creeran on stink yea said you get colonel caroil add a on a dot canyadas jacko that's right aisles i think i don't know what it is for it's less actually i put it on the on the website on both website the jocatore on lake and the jockeycap so ill we yea and all aneanti of us a discount so or so on it is giving or listening to discometer per cent my people and what i did find out on on it regardless of whatever is kind you get the you have free shipping on everything except my one o save that the big olaneta belabut everything else says somnolent free shipping all witches kind o seems like a small deal and doing the cause i sold things on line and stuff before like anserinae course i bought things on mine but an when you step free shipping i'm not it's just something it seems small real slight you legion of feel it you know leniit wouldn't unhelpable brighton not sometlmes you take it peformed with ask me that in college is whatever one wants to hankinson's cause they think for some reason that supplements give you big muscle or something they don't sail figaro the whole work in all beadwork it up being even yet that was secondary um but yet and then o injudicial less about muscles the epileptic through it you know it's actually you get kind of teatime times and you to you have big muscles we are you don't get keys to but you lose credit for your skill in sugeon your side yes at that do i but you kind o do get to every like wherewherewhere you know you get down rondini man your shirting doateth years friday you has nothing to do with it yet i take a the only supplement i think alphabets ant another and i will in dotage a pre work up which is a mean i'm going to be on his other norfield take a reworked work out as just you know what that is ready essie a little powder it's like insistin it you laugh ariusian it topically and on and on to night rick night ricochet basically make your fame otiose your vessels get dilated so it delegate more of a palm begin energy it's just like it's facey stimulant energy well you know if you're not in the motorworks i out but in this little quiet sweet little comely put apparaissent with it or just with coffee drink him coffee and the illorin in sinai at the same time peahood want to work out you'll want owor out without sockeyes so yeah that's it that's pretty much it it's funny because a lot of people did think that if you take protein powder it'll make your muscles big like it'll help you get big muscles um but no like if you take your favourite supplement which is stakes normal you know and if you're working out a genet little bit more that's a head big muscles work out good and have the correct work out for muscles which is different and work out then if you wanted you know get conditioning or something like that and then he did oughtenter after you work out i manteueto that too i think no actually i think i don't i cakeshops actually somebody put on toward her the debt i was right there is a ahamadou you're not paying ostrom release sir h t h o the same kind of something happening your system will research that one eye yes i do have unengaging now at all jorogata them call it broad exactly in a way give it on domisil road right now that would be wrong but yes to enter that the question supplements all pop that like an every day supplement to elberthaler work on and oo from shrine tech o in i've been taken even before we started to focatico shoote no riever year you know fired up for the three cayuses he gave you the card oulahans it assent we we have to kanofelin the cogitatio know and i lay me more imagination a in the past rain and they could save to sad on fuencarral by saying there was a little bit of a cariateen that would be reached very quick how action the mat slip more accurately being tired was more than issue for me like dealing with being tired onusable to get tidily just don't care like that henderson like you'll get it but you ll just keep it go see didn't have that no osoppo it so yes i sold when i take the hroom text for you could see i can feel it i could feel like it's like you almost like you i expect to get more tired than you really are but a felt so he is taken that before but that's in specific cases only with juglike a from doing like conditioning like now like a meccanian the iron take it but you shouldn't want to give yourself the extra and yet it's like it seems like it i'm training us for conditioning is handling i want a togoyama now he but up elated on the supplement to there i will take the cruel old noll for sure cause some that's going to help me last question jack i would enjoy hearing your thoughts on leading others to a strong finish in both a deployment and in the seven life missus as you something that i saw in combat matheny first appointment carack and it's something i try to train out of people and that was a tendency to relax once a target was secure of the vehicles were loaded and we were leaving the target area people would have a tendency to let their guard down but you can't let your guard down then or ever really and in training when i was running training we always had the button hard on tarde but we always we always hit him even a harder after they left the target one they were petrol and back to base and their mind in already gone home and then turned off that'll bring it to be hid him from multiple angles with all kinds of man because i wanted to insist heal into them i wanted to instill that attitude the muscle memory to always keep going and always stay focused a cat as the mentality that you have to have as that is never finished it isn't never finished you always have to do more another mission another task another go and have that attitude that the enemies always watching and waiting and looking looking and studying you for that moment of weakness be can for you to axel put your weapon down and close your eyes natiata so my rule is don't be finished starting to let be ready be attacking be relentless at the enemy stopped let the enemy rest let the enemy finish but you don't finish don't stop don't rest not to be enemies comply this aroan even man even then when the enemies gone that when you turn that focus in word on yourself and you take the opertunity to that of rest but as always you take that our tunity to make yourself better faster smarter stronger than we those goes nothing is ever an ashes they sat rybody fortunio the part cast and listening to its tantesberg and reviewing and spread in the word telling
