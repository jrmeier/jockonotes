this is jacopo cast number fourteen with echo charles and me jackwell income good evening a gleaming now i want you to imagine yourself in the moment the moment just prior to the battle of a i don't want you to think of because your soldier that this train is made you into some kind of a superhuman or maybe to a different kind of being because it hasn't the training that you've been through hasn't changed the fact that you are a human being all warriors argument being that so this is you in talking to and i once you have think about that time before you are going into the battle because that's the time when you can actually think when you are waiting when you are waiting to go and if you're goin to feel fear this is where you feel it because you have time the preparation is down the planting is done the briefing his dawn the gears prepared and you are dressed and you are ready to go and now you're just waiting waiting for the call or for the signal or for the command to execute and so you have time to think and in fact all you can do at that moment i think and if you are not rack maybe you're waiting to go into the elaberate romani where there's been vicious i d said casualties happening every day for months on end or if you're in vietnam maybe you're no alcocer theodolite part in an air assault on a known enemy strong hold her fine if you're in the corean war maybe your hearing the whistles the whistles signaling a corinated attack by the red army had you just waiting waiting for the shooting i start take efterward maybe you're just off shore ernani graft and the sound of explosions and gun fire in the distance on the beach where you're headed the beach or waiting to hitani's world war one perhaps your waiting in europe tannenberg er vidura but you're weading to go over the top out of that trench and in tehomian das amantha moment what do you think about he think about family friends you think about your life do you think about deaf you think about that girl you you wish that you would have asked a marry maybe you're thinking out i get myself into this tore maybe your thinking how do i get myself out of this amadeus sitting there rethinking the plan and the sequence and the orders you were given may be you thinkin about your friends getting killed or wounded maybe you think about yourself gen kilronan you could be thinking about so many different things but one thing is certain whatever you are thinking about whatever those thoughts are those thought your clear those thoughts are any insight into your true nature into your being in the year iselin maybe that's nothing may be that is the thing we miss about combats and you do welwas hear about the adrenal in russian the excitement in the challenge of combat but one about the cleansing of the mind against a backdrop of deaf as like there's the same purity that can only be revealed by the horror in the blood and the violence of impending combat a nashing these parties this moment when you realize that who being as is as its other people its other humans tenenan wonder they thinking are they why are they what are they and what of my doing here why why am i hear and despite all those thoughts and all those ideas and all those questions there is only one answer in the politics they disappear and the thoughts disappear in the fears and the reservations and the concern and the ego it all disappears because at that moment that loganosh there is only one answer ford forward into the battle into the fray toward the smoke and the fire and the bullets and the bombs and towards death to face it all head on and maybe maybe that is what the real addition of combats may be that what we unfor maybe those those thoughts that fill our dreams and are nightmares to be there again in the breach the have but one clear and resounding purpose but everything in our lives everything are world everything in past and present in future alit wrapped up he did not an instant to have that one singular purpose for being alive at that moment to attack a tack with everything you have with every ounce commitment with every bit of clarity and focus that you as a human being can possibly muster a tack with your weapons and your mind and your body and attack with your very soul and maybe that purity is what we miss is what i mess about combat and so let's go back there once again once again to the battle field to world war one again in my mind the most brutal of all wars were tattics and intelligence and strategy did not matter it was a treason and death and horror rendered possible only because of the purest and almost insane level of selflessness and bravery and this starts off that very situation waiting for combat i sat up for a long time that night in the foreboding eve of battle mood of which all soldiers at all times have left report on a tree stump coston with blue animals before i crept over the ranks of my comrades to the tent i had tangled dreams in which a principle role was played by a skull in the morning the tender green of young leaves shimmered in the flat light we followed hidden twisting paths toward a narrow gorge behind the front line on the dough of noon all artillery launched into a furious bombardment that echoed and re echoed through the hall to the wooded hollows for the first time we heard what was meant by the expression drum fire we sat perched on her habit haversacks idol and excited a runner plunged through the company to the company commander brisk exchange the free ner trenches are fallen us and six field guns to encapture loud cheers rang out a feeling of up and adam at last at last the long for order in a long line we moved forward toward the pattering of heavy rifle fire it was getting serious to the side of the forest path go thump came down in a clump of firs bring down rain of branches and soil on derosier threw himself to the ground then death calls slip through the ranks ambulance men to the front a little later we passed the spot that had been hit the casualties had already been removed bloody scraps and cloth and flesh had been left on the bushes around the crater a strange and dreadful sight that put me in mind of the butcher bird that spike its prey on for bushes we entered the battle trampled realm of the infantry men the area round the jumping off position had been deforced it by the shells and the ripped up no man's land lay the victims of the attack still facing the enemy their great tonically stood out from the ground a giant form with red blood spattered beard stared fixed the at the sky his fingers clutching the spongeous a young man tossed in a shell crater his features already yellow with an ending death he seemed not to want to be looked at he gave his a crossrun and pulled his coat over his head and lay still in a curious failure of comprehension i looked alertly about me for possible targets for all this artillery fire not apparently realizing that it was actually ourselves that the enemy enemy gunners were trying for all they were worth to hit ambulance men we had our first fatality a shape baldric through rifle and stone stollers caught corodiers three packets of lint were sod with blood and no time in a matter of seconds he bled to death in the rising mist i leapt out of the trench and found a shrunken french corpse flesh like moldering this gleam greenlet greenishly through slits in the shredded uniform turning round i took a step back in hall next to me was a figure crouched against a tree it's still had gleaming french lever harness and on its back was a fully pappatorio topped by a round messines sockets and a few strands of hair on it on the bluish black skull indicated that the man was not among the living there was another sitting down slump forward towards his feet as though he had just collapsed all around or dozens more rowed dried stiffened to mummies frozen in the erians of death the french must have spent months in proximity of their fancourt without bearing them i had the torso was jammed in some shot up beams head in neck or gone white cartilage gleamed out of a reddish black flesh i found it difficult to fathom speceis very young man lay on his back with glassy eyes and fist still aiming a peculiar feeling looking into dead questioning eyes a shudder that i never quite lost in the course of the war as pocket had been turned inside out and his empty wallet lay beside him so that right there is a portion of the opening chapters of a book called storm of steel going into the introduction of the book at her storm of steel is one of the great books of world war one if not the greatest ornung er at the author erst younger's book on the nineteen fourteen war storm of steel is without question the finest beforn war that i know utterly honest truthful in good faith in contrast with most of the others is start it has no pacific design it makes no personal appeal it is notably unconstructed buck it is not set it offer and as experience in any sort of context it offers nothing in the way of house and wise it is pure where and when and of course above all what there is nothing in it about the politics of war nothing even on its outcome and very little on the wider strategy of its conduct war is all fighting is all everything else is cropped away and from first to last in the affirmative it is the work of a man whom the war made so to little but of a different kind of book wonota some in explaining the baron explaining the bone and just how it is it's just about the fighting yet the justest right or ye and that's one of the things that makes it so powerful is also one of the things that bratley well what it feels like to be on the front lines when politics don't matter when the outcome does'ent aeacum of the broader war doesn't matter any more what are we doing right now in this trench talking about being in these trenches which he yet now obvious goal these soldiers spent an immense amount of time they lived in these trenches back to the book the desolation and the profound silence sporadically broken by the crump of shells were heightened by the sorry impression of devastation repeater sack broken rifles scraps of cloth counterpointed grotesquely with children's toys shell fuses deep craters from explosions bottles harvestin elements shredded books battered household gear wholes whose gaping darkness betrayed the presence of basements where the bodies of unlucky inhabitants of the houses were not by the particularly assidious swarms of rats in the cattle bars and stables and barns the bones of live stock still dangling from their chains trenches dug through ravaged gardens in among sprouting bolds of unions warmer robarts's buried under weeds on the neighboring fields drain bars through whose roofs grain the grain was already sprouting all that would have buried communication trench running through it and all suffused with the smell of burning and decay sad thoughts are apt to sneak up on the warrior in such a low cow when he thinks of those who only recently led their lives in tranquillity treacly providing a caution to people little caution the warriors that when you see you know these babies to alys and this normal village that's been ripping out trenches running through it and you can't let that sneak up on you he says that he motioned you've got i detach yourself from that and speaking of the raps here he says they are repellent creatures and am always thinking of the secret desecrations they perform on the bodies and the village basements one as i was striding through the ruins of montmorin a warm night they came oozing out of their hiding places in such undescribable numbers that the ground was like a volaret of them pater with the occasional white of an albino so so many rats for of all so many rats that it looks like a carpet and so many rats at theirs actually a regular current of albiona's a modern rats and talk about life in the trench were real red isaac to the corner reared in men who can turn her hand to anything in the trenches make their thousand fold the man's on us every day we sink deep shafts construct dug outs and concrete pill boxes regular and tanglements to find drain it systems revett support level raise in smooth filling the trains in a word we do all possible tasks ourselves so these guys are in the business of constructing their house constructing the trenches that they live in they live in the dug outs which is like a lower part of the trench where they diggin they build all the stuff themselves that's what they do and then in the middle of that back to the book a century collapses streaming blood shot the head his comrades rip the bandage roll out of his tunic and get him bandaged up there's no point bill come on he still breathing as he then the stretcher bearers come along to carry him to the dressing station the stretcher pulls collided with the corners of the fire bay no sooner has the man disappeared than everything is back to the way it was before some one spread a few shovelfuls of earth over the red pottle and every one goes back to whatever he was doing only a new recruit may be lean to gainst the revetment looking a little green about the gills he's endeavouring to put it all the gather such an incredibly brutal so sudden with no warning given it can't be possible it can't be real poor fellow if only you knew what was in the store for you seven october nineteen fifteen standing at dawn on the fire step opposite our dug out next to the century when a rifle bullet ripped through his force cap without harming a hair of his head at the same time two pioneers were wounded on the wires one had a ricochet folk shot through both legs the other a ball through his ear in the morning the century atoacan was shot through both cheek bones the blood spurted out of him in thick gals and a capital when lieutenant von ewald visiting our sector to take pictures of sack and barely fifty yards away turned to climb down from the outlook a bullet shattered the back of his scolded on the spot large fragments of skull were left littering the century platform also a man was hit the shoulder but not badly the middle of the potion section of trench was attacked with six ten shells one man was hurled against a post by the blast so hard he sustained serious internal injuries and a splinter of wood punche artery in his arm that night two men were wounded qualebone wire gemit was shocking both hands and one five and safer took a bullet in the knee following a torrential downpour in the night all the traverses came down and formed a grace logic porridge with the rein turning the trench into a deep swamp our only consolation was at the british were just as badly off as we were because we could see them bailing out for all they were worth since our position has a little more elevation in theirs we even manage to pump or excess there away so he is there almost face to face with the british there getting a down pour of rain and they take a little satisfaction the fact that they can actually fondle some of the water into the brish trench that's how close they are the crumble trench walls explode exposed a line of bodies left there from the previous autumn fighting i was standing next to curatorial weemen in front of the altenburg redoubt when a long shot passed through his bayonet which he was carrying over a shoulder and gave him a bad wound in the groin so this is kind of the daily life that he talks about being stuck in these trenches and it's just pure it's bruno can kind o get the the matter of factness that he don't liver so much of this with dokoisho this gun was shot this guy went his leg blown off each just like boom boom boom boom you when he went on tell he noticed some one else reacting to that when meanwhile it's just reattracted him but just the other guy reacting to it stands out you know that's all matter of fact it is in the book which i kind of got into beginning talked about some of this first combat that he is exposed to hegoes on to go through i mean just the botanising would is sixty thousand casualties in the first day sixty thousand cattle pies in the first day you know there was fifty thousand kildon vietnam a man face thousand americans killed the eton were talking sixty thousand casualties the first day and in three months there was a million a million it's the the whole state of alameda to it's it's it's dis unbelievable what this war was it really was and it's really unfathomable as i think about what the guns were ordered to do and the fact that he did it over and over and over again we we have we have more respect for human life now than we did then period i don't care what anybody says we have more respect for human life now than they did then maybe that means were weaker may be a mean to or more cowardly but just to send millions of men to their death for a river that didn't really have in strategic at that was true its it it's it's it's all right now able to think about and so on or getting i leave that different for people to read you know the bulk of the middle the book here goes in these details but then i kind of moving forward here more towards the end of the book in our getting into these really pretty fierce battles and and also its interesting as this is wine starts seeing the enemy that likeneth other trenches but now he started them face to face and indeed we heard on twenty nine november from captain on bricks in that we were that we were to take part in a sweeping color offensive against the boats that the tank battle at cambray had made in our front even though we were pleased to play a part of the hammer having so long been the anvil we wondered whether the troops still exhausted from flanders then be up to the job that said i had every confidence in my company they had never let any one down yet on the night of furriner to one to camber we were put on lauriston in the process we took our first losses as a soldier dropped the hand grenade which for some reason exploded gravely injuring him in another man some one else feigned insanity in attempt to get out of the battle after a lot of two wing in froing a buffet in the ribs from an enzio seemed to sort em out and we were able to go it showed me that that sort of play acting is difficult to keep up now i've talked about this before and if you didn't go the last time i talked about it and look at the shell shocked videos of world war one on you to there are rific to watch and you realize what this war did the people and i pulled this section at because you was a guy oh probably had gone completely insane and he's like saying this guy feigned insanity he just said you know what this guy facing you know even though it probably was he vuole probably was he says you know what beat this guy up tell me suck it up and now we can go and have exactly what happened right and that's they'll kind o the attitude right remember you saying the cantharides back then it would absolutely was the attitude it was the attitude tethea about i mean it as of pain more teniente on the british side but you always you came back from the war with all your limbs and you want to medical word meaning you were in here because you had psychological problems the the was because you were a coward at ermine which is a sick it's sickening yet think bureau were saying life met less than or it were it means more like human life i i think it's just isaac knowledge you know like they looked into it over the years and stuff and they kind of coheiresses the pits and the shell showing a tea every one we've learned all kinds about that you but it is really arable when you see those of videos of what they or of what the war did the people on and that's what war does do to people you know we got her remember that that it impacts people in in a horrible way and this war to me especially more so the netherward primarily because of the conditions and from the indirect fire the mortars in the shilling and again at something that you have no control over and also you could see these guys had no control over their their fate there be get told to do something they were going to do it and if you weren't going to do it you are out word yet you know if you're the protest and say he is to seem like a good plan to me it wouldn't be well okay what's your strategic opinion wouldn't your tact i cufic are tactful brain tell you knows no you're a gower and that's why it's so important really in any endeavor especially in war but in a war in business to to have an open mind from a leadership position to listen to what people are saying because they might be right in a curiara te real rehoused and thousands if not hundreds of thousands of soldiers that were at hanau this doesn't make any sense and part of it isn't comition them to say you know what no i mean it like we talked about with a foin maxim right the onions maxim was if you are a water of a problem with an order and you carried out and i get your guys killed your capable sons so these guys obviously hadn't read that and had you know hadn't had taken out on board will you listen to your subordinates and you say okay will you think of this plan we've tried it twelve times in the past you know monthault or in a try to get to morrow we're going to get up at the sound of the whistle or go a charge towards these other enemy machine guns as a work yet but we think it might work tomorrow no one figured that out listen to your people and listen to your brain you know listen to your common sense don't get stuck don't get stuck in a mental rowit anything and it's so easy to look if you could send millions of human tither death because you can't think your way out of the strata you can't identify his dragees being wrong you can't come up with a new way to execute something that shows you how trapped in a box your brain can get an noton you but your bodies that are all thinking the same way you're all feeding off each other within festal ideas that are the same ideas being fed to one another and it leads to this back to the book suddenly there were some commotion at the british barricade handgrenades flew rifles banged machine guns clattered their coming their coming we leaped behind sand bags and started shooting in the heat of the battle one of my men copaleen house jumped on to the parapet and fired down into the trench until he was brought down by two bad wounds in his arms i took note of this hero of the hour and was proud to congratulate him two weeks later on a ward of the iron cross first class no sooner had we got back from this interruption to our lunch the new was more pandemonium he was one of those curious incidents that in suddenly and unpredictably transform and entire situation the noise was coming from a subaltern in the regiment on our left who wanted to lying up with us and seemed inflamed by a baser fury drink seemed to have kept his interveres into towering rage where are the tommies lamiam come on boys whose coming with me it is infinite fury he knocked over a fine barricade and plunged forward clearing a path for himself with hand grenades so this guy as you know going after it he is the ill described as being like almost drunk maybe he actually is drunk but he's just standing up and charging charging forward clearing a path from self in hand grenades back to the book his orderly slipped ahead of him along the trench shooting down any one who survived the explosion explosions bravery bravery fearless risking of one's own wife is always inspiring we too found ourself ourselves picked up by his wild fury and scrabbling round to gravified rushed to form part of this brazier's project progress soon i was up alongside him tearing along the line and the other officers too followed by riflemen from my company even captain von breckon the bataan commander was up there in the van rifian bringing down enemy hand grenade for ours the british resisted manfully every chafers had to be fought for for the black balls of mills bombs as britishers crossed in the air with our own long handled grenades behind every traverse we captured we found corpses or bodies still twitching we killed each other sight unseen we too suffered losses a piece of iron crashed into the ground next to the orderly which the fellow was unable to avoid and he collapsed the ground while his blood issued on to the clay from his many wounds we hurt we hurled we heard a lover's body and charged forwards thunderous crashes pointed us the way hundreds of pairs of eyes were lying in wait behind rifles and machine guns in dead man's land we were already a long way from our own front lines from all sides bullets whistled round our steel helmets or struck the trench parapet with a hard crack each time a black iron oval broke the horizon one eyes size it up with that instantaneous clarity of which a man is only capable in moments of life and death during those instances of waiting you had to try and get to a place where you could see as much of the sky as possible because was only against its pale back drop that it was possible to see the black jagged iron of those deadly balls with sufficient clarity then you hurled your own bomb and leap forward one barely glanced at the crumpled body of one's opponents he was finished and a new duel was commencing in the exchange of hand grenades reminded me of fencing with foils needed a jump and stretched almost as in a ballet it is the dead beast of duels as it invariably ends with one of the protestants or the other being blown to smithereens or both hand grenade fights and just a kind of explained that a little bit is one thing that you you've got we definitely learn in this yollande you are patrolling at night and this is especially before night vision when you wanted to seed a person in front of you and especially like to see your hand signals cause we you know wise all hands signalant if you want to see them you kinda get down on her knee and you put the you put the hat like a back light behind of you can see what handsome nor passing and what he is doing here as they're trying to get as low as they can in back like the sky is much they can't see they can see the grenades that are blue thrown at him and then when they do get thrown out of a thing get up to a spot where they don't think it's going to blow up and then their hawker own grades back in these moments i was capable of seeing the dead i jumped over them with every stride without horror they lay there in their laced and softly spilled attitude that characterizes those moments in which life takes its leave now they get the now they get the british kind of trapped the trench they were trying to escape down doubled back on itself towards ours like a curved frame of a leer and at the narrowest point they were only ten paces apart so they had to pass us again from our elevated position were able to look down on the brig helmet as they stumbled in their haste and excitement i tossed a hander nadin form of the first lot bringing them up short and after them all the others then they were stuck in a frightful jam hand grenades flew through the air like snow balls covering everything in milk white smoke fresh bombs were handed up to us from below lightnings flashed between the huddled british healing up rags of flesh and uniforms and helmets there were mingled cries of rage and fear with fire in our eyes we jumped consider lip of the trench the rifles of the whole area were pointed at us suddenly in my delirium i was knocked to the ground as by a hammer blow sober i pulled off my helmet and saw to my terror that there were two large holes in it to that mormon leaping up through sisteme assured me that had a bleeding scratch at the back of my head nothing more a bullet shot from some distance at punched through my helmet and then only brushed my skull half unconscious i reeled back with a hurriedly applied bandages to remove myself from the eye of the storm no sooner had i passed the nearest traverse that a man ran up behind me and told me that cab had just been killed in the same place by a shot ahead the news floored me a frind of mine with noble qualities with whom i shared joy sorrow and danger for years now wholly a few moments ago had called out some pleasantry to me taken from life by a kindly piece of leg i could not grasp the fact on fortunately it was all too true but in this murderous sector of trench all my ends and a third of my company were bleeding to death shot and had rained down peterhof on another one was another one of the fallen and older man a teacher by profession a german school master in the best sense of the word my two encens and many others besides were wounded and yet the seventh company held on to the conquered line under the command of lieutenant hop and wrath the only able bodied officer remaining until we relieved of all the stimulating moments in a war there is none to compare with the encounter of two storm troop commanders in the narrow clay walls of a line there is no going back and no pity and every one knows who is seen of them in their kingdom the aristocrat of the trench with horror determined visage brave to the point of folly leaping adular and back with keen blood thirsty eyes men who answered the demands of the hour and whose names go down in no chronicle and i think as we read the books right these books these are chronicles somebody wrote this guy lived and wrote but he's making a specific point here he he used to turn the aristocrat of the trench and it's not the carinae the term aristocrat that it an it's not the you know the the snobbiest and rather thought he salabut you you look up a definition of aristocrat and one of the meanings of this like the the best of whom thus we talk about these ties that were the best guise in the trench the head the horror look that would canaster it and yet their names go down and no chronicle and i'll tell you i know many many brave men in the seal teams in the marine corps in the army brave souls that were aristocrats of warm and their name will go down and no conillac battle two men who had just ahead of us tried to make it back over the top one toppled back into the trench with a shot the head the other shot in the belly could only crawl into it we hunkered on the floor a wait and smoke english cigarettes from time to time well aimed rifle grenades came flying over we were able to see them and take a vase of action the man with the wound in the belly a very young lad lay in amongst us stretched out like a cat in the warm rays of the setting sun he slipped into death with an almost child like smile on his face it was a sight that didn't oppress me but left me with a fraternal feeling for the dying man even the groaning of his comrade gradually fell silent he died in our midst shuddering is that that line there really come or he died in our midst shuddering and it's i think what catches you about its petite is contrasted with the other one who died with an old child like smile on his face as i was thinking when he keeps this much defiant i say the eskimos have thousand words for snow because they are so familiar with snow and these men were face with so much death that they saw the the the varied faces of death now different they are yea and you know one thing that i i remember from some of the older vietnam seal talking to me about gustave been wounded missus you know ah in the nineties so i had no idea anything about combat in i remember like they were telling me hey you know sometimes guys get winded beg shop and in it does a good doesn't haseman is part of it a physiology like if you get shot ascertain place it just doesn't it doesn't do anything you know even you can drive off and then you have some one else could shot in a different place you know an i jist it does not he you do by god blows their femur porter it is there it in such a way that they can not there just down and then to agonizing pain where some one else make good ship shot on a through and through meaning it just goes in one side and out the other and it's all like they don't even notice it yet because it is happened so fast had in so fast in his and cause any traumatic image and then you have the psychological aspect where some people psychology they get a hit and their fleeing outwitted and some other people are argued i got hit us leave you on hautton's worry bout me an got time to believe ye so so those are some situations that the yard just different and in nesesiti obviously when this guy sees as after death after death after death he sees the very able and the various faces of death so so now we were getting towards the end and he's a man this is at a point now where there start a recognised that they're going to lose the warm and what's crazy about that is not now okay if you if you tell me a weighting for a country okay i get it we're going to try vainly remake him sacrifices he's got it now recognized that their probably not run a wind and he's kind of given his guise a brief before they go into another of salt i paraded my company in battle order in a small apple orchard standing under an apple tree i addressed a few words to the men who were drawn up in front of me in a horseshoe arrangement they looked serious and manly there wasn't much to say in the course of the last few days and with a kind of sweepingness that is only to be explained by the fact that an army is not only men under arms but also men fused with a sense of common purpose probably every one of them had come to understand that we were on our uppers and on our uppers is an expression that means it's like when you are in poverty only don't have the means any more so they knew he knew that they were on their last legs they knew that they were on their last legs he goes on with every attack the enemy came forward with more powerful means his blows were swifter and more devastating every one knew we could no longer win but we would stand firm but we would stand firm now there in its final battle i had a very impartial feeling as if i were able to view myself through by notules you can see now become in detached for the first time in the entire war i heard the hissing of individual bullets as if they were whistling past some target we were coming down hill indistinct figures moved to against a background of red brown clay a machine gun spat out its gouts of bullets the feeling of hopelessness increased even so we broken to a run while the gunners found were finding their range we jumped over several snipers nests and hear le excavated trenches in mid jump over a slightly better made trench i felt a piercing jolt in the chest as though i had been hit like a game bird when a sharp cry that seemed to cost me all the air i had a spot on my access and crashed to the ground eight had got me at last at the same time as feeling i had been hit i felt the bullet taking away my life i had felt death's hand once before on the road at more but this time it's his grip was foreran more determined as i came down heavily on the bottom of the trench i was convinced it was all over strangely that moment is one of the very few in my life of which i am able to say they were utterly happy i understood as in a flash of lightning the true inner purpose and form of my life i felt surprised and disbelief that it was the end there and then but the surprise had something untroubled and almost merry about it then i heard the firing grow less as if i were a stone sinking under the surface of some turbulent water where i was going there was unaware nor any well obviously he did survive that wounding because he was able to write this book and he wrote many other books the book is called a storm of steel by earnest kyoung erin as i wrap up these books again sometimes i feel like you know a where do i compare this and i tied in an maoliosa either a lesson to leadership and strict chatain in otacite bit about listening to your troops and keeping an open mind and even though you know they started off in the description this book is saying you don't there's no passivists leaning in this book but something that i often remind people about all the guise that he fought and wars is that if there is any body that looks at war and says let's try to avoid it if we can it's the guise that had been there the guise that i fought we don't want to send our friends to war we don't want to send kids to war and i think this book is a reminder of just how bad it can be and just how horrible a thing that war is now of course that always comes with the cavia of the fact that there are things that are more evil than war and there are things that can only be stopped there is evil that can only be stopped there the waging of war but when you do have to go to war because the evil must be stopped then god a word a wind than when decisively so you don't put man through horrors for nothing when back to that the the part where you talk about him guides getting hit and they deal with an indifferent people to have different reactions on one satinalia bullet happened so fast i don't think your nerves really register ourminds on where you because your but that bullet could go through your arm yes you don't notice it or go to your arm and hit your your bone only northerlie let grace the one you could hit upon a cold shout of the one ye i saw guy that got hidden the bone in its devastating yeah and you see guys that got through and through and you and their fine yet there literally fine yes and so that's you know warieties there's a there's a huge element of chance in it ye man you know actually got there's an internet question that i got asked and i didn't i don't think we we brought it up but it onoway somebody said how do you deal with the random ness of warm like you could decide on it i do how do you with the ranier and for me it's the way i dealt with the random for is the really simple thought of o'toole can control you and if i can't control in a mocking worry about it yes you can't worry about the random snipers shop i mean you can do everything you can't mitigate it you don't want your out there in the field you know you keep moved away moving you say beyond convers much you can you don't come up in the same spot open over ten you do the the things to mitigate the risk but you can't just be dwelling on it red because you can't control it the same thing as getting hit with a random i do random of indirect fire from a mortar and you cannot mitigate all that risk so would you do you do everything you can to mitigate and then you know you worry about the things you can control me and i used to tell that to managers do in if told that story before you know listen guys are get worried there go getting ocote going to get caught us submission yet a you've done everything you can to mitigate that you've trained you condition yourself you spared you done miss you've got everything that you can do if that happens you can't control it ye yet it happens you can't control it so don't even worry about it ye will it not the things you can't control the pace of the fight putting the fight where you wanted to be winning the round being attacked icewater about those things don't worry about getting knocked out get a what deep your hands up keep your head movement keep the distance in correct those are things that to keep you get it from getting knocked out but you can't mitigate all that rescue in a fist fight you and in a fist fight some people come times people get work knocked out and in a warm sometimes people get wounded and sometimes people get killed you know an you can not mitigate that risk away it's a war then you gotta deal with it remember this in some papaya comparatively speaking but am i shot my own hand one time was the one but batignoles to turn in to tell the story to pope the public you know there's a lesson in there the orator even a lesson it's like a less it don't shoot your

shipping on everything except for the heavy heavy items which are the wataklasat in you do it first question can you talk about your training schedules rolls witches jigit training in one calm reeve ulana's freron foreright in the event of them not knowing we rodenai so can you talk about your trains hides your rolls and what is a typical week what what is the place well for me in i work out her day so what i mean they are more to wake up early and i get it on a live weight said you calloused you some kind of sprinting evolution seventies a week seven days a week then and as i explained to many people on the twitter they say don't you ever take a day off and i do but i don't plan to take these off days off life brings days off you got the broken water heater you've got the sick kids you got sick he you got tuh the call broke down you got the event that school whatever it is some there some reason there's some travel plans that don't allow it said there's life will give you days off don't take off days voluntarily don't do that let the days off come through life and then ben you not have to freak out about me discolored if deydras am a travel or on a road you don't aim is a work out to day i can take it as a day rest so but i do i will work out every day and part of that is going off instinctive one i feel like of what type or work out a andon and by that sometimes i mean i don't feel like doing a certain kind of work out therefore i'm going and do it reastonish ment for be weak the and in the same only you know what i do not want to do that kind of work i'll tell because i feel an impending injury o ye here like him in a literal heavy today no not to day i'm eight i'm sore i'm gonna not do that type of work out to day so it's a little combination of instinct fell and disappointed verses freedom of you know what this is going to be too much ready i want to lift every day or i don't feel sometimes i feel like letting have i owner words i'm maybe drained i'm drained to do some kind of oviduct or or other a man consorts gonna go in there and just just do some singles and of it a somebody you feel you know i mean i don't feel like putting any heavy way up to them to go in there and do something lighter but may be high repetitions and that that things so i'm doing that every day you know callisthenes some dams and doing a combination of all free momson one so that's just you tom getting after it and again i think at some point marrit in it e book because the publishing process in opposing waltari pain and in the ebooks not entedian evil cause easier the easier to do you do it you produce it you put it through a mason an amazon just as i coseyest i could so for like three bucks a day and the name one can want em to it get it and he doesn't have to be i don't feel bad if i don't you know it's not the it's something that i could do to war i wanted to do i don't have to unapelike i don't think make it a certain lane oh but no i manteen it's twenty eight pages that's the information i have is not you know someone could haycock we want you to write a fit in his book then it's got to be a hundred and twenty seven pages he had his got to have a bunch of things in it that i want to talk about cause it's not that complicated right so to any seven pages e book downloaded printed out everybody can have it and cost three bucks people are stoke were all good people can stop asking me what my work out or like one because everybody wants to know that oudney i'm not etsetra do you know so there's no work out and sedate thinking to doing umden again that's that's a been thinking about actually getting some one in saint e you seem like a capable human out we read a little evacuate you what to plemont and you do it why so it like sounds still for a heedious so it gets done cause are elms busy re too busy for them said miss eleckit now yes so i got a etat on and i got a move that up on my chart because i know people want to get out that okay so then on top o workin out there's the surface which after's waves on serving right that's just the way goes if there's good ways of curing these not always good ways but if there's ways of surfing want thing i need do more of it just go out and battle niederer constantly and shapeable a serf boarded kind of conditioning more n that aleinos to be in shape for battle and nice kind like i been saying haveand i'll put a ruck sack then you on the ruggeri you want to get good at doing post to both while you want to be good a paddle in a surf board you got a battle sir fort nansie you always feel weak when the big waves come and you haven't served in a while then you feel weak because you haven't been paddling at the discipline so i should be battling more and then we get to them the judithe rove the desert so our roll of home i'm going to the gym and i'm training ah you know we usually do some jack me i usually get a little some from jeff for from dean and in a dim and jeff be with crazy is you can always learn something and still freaks me out you know because it's not like when i say learn something i'm not like saying that they're teaching me some new very ation to the gogolian they're teaching them like benwell say hey when you put the guilty on over here make this adjustment or when you're passing gonerdo this here like some simple thing more jestures lever was inagua my son to the dartois watched him give my son you know like a seven men at class on the darco no my son you know can you imagine you're getting your nine years old and you're getting a personal class on the dartonia but my son do know he just thinks that's normal but i'm watching a and a remembered jeff was discing over little details and as stuff that i had did not know to corlear the darts wheelerite dar choke in werther's always these little things and i was i surprised at the obviousness of those things and as she does happen occasionally in the other direction you know dan was going through a slump resell having a hard time passing my guard and i i said a man you been doing why is to ax and he egesias his face because he has a ameaning my light i saw his face as soon as i told him that it was a cangias a connection made than he instantly started past again those dam but one but yet you get these little obvious things you get the you get the the learned you always trying to live on something and then you know there's the situational drills of going in and then there's a finer than reality here's the reality man i like to rome yet i like to roll that's the reality of it i enjoy training not starting in not starting on position and going into no i like to train as i like to do this or love about you jetsome to roll and a roll and whenever i go in my goal is to roll and the same boy that i will some nights ago in like there was somebody i go in or night and and you mermaids feel like long sickle in and roll some days i'm like you know what man i not feel in it today and because i'm not feeling it to day i'm goin to get it on then i'll force myself that kind of that's kind o like when you're a kid in um you start crying or something and you dead tell you ll give you something to cry about delitigate feel like it all you don't feel like it i'll give you something to not feel it it or what it aright it is at an end and like a couple of weeks ago i said to my gotten did not feel like rolling and i said to myself i'm not going to stop until everybody stock i tell you no he was houseservant guys on the mat and then after three rounds thirst you know fifteen guys are sixteen guys in the mad and then it down day ten and then eight in four and in its menone other god like looks like if you got the last round my friend but i just did that for myself it's a little form of its little form of exercising will dispute but that being said there is laisain and and i don't feel it and i don't feel as a different sense that i have which is today is not going to be good to him and thee something to i'm too i'm to war down or whatever and so i'll go i'll do i'll do some rolls and then i'll just i'll just leave it at that you know i won't i won't force myself to stay on the matravers i do again i use that instinct of of what i am feeling to make a decision on ounces going to go down the line one day oh gregg he ran only a a came in his are ye like i just feel like i'm going to break my tooth somewhere he said that the you like anatole you just feel that he is a cat a feel like it that day i broke my toe i never break it it was like cinderella or open like that but it's with us weird right i know waited from point but still oh so my worked out talitre fast different in yours i work out average five days a week but they're not everything all in one so all if i roll three days all lived in to me condenado and that kind of stuff to day blue yes so i sold you like we do with all your free time may make it of gratian with a samudratire a week you track three ogeeehee sometimes to unless i'm like super busy than one day yea but yeah baton escaping is doing six yet owin to a as not to distreebute i'll do running lifting conditioning so and then a different session i did troittoir you know that entails on time thing is you ladoucette nice but i'll typically he how many rounds the hay like on a typical day you know how you'll do some technique lettable class or training seconee you do some technique and uh maybe some drills six and then around right you six rounds in that solid what five minutes six ministers six six min rounds ainalekite had strange because the one time we did like a that we had to gems closed but we had dealt on open bat but was open that was like a warnerian we did wait we who like of one noontime you will probably there i don't know i don't remember but we did six six minute rounds no gee and in six six minute round keeteetee i usually don't get tired her i got tired that day well i got tired that the year the how's the gay to it i'd go to i have i been taught to sit on all few months now but um i'd go there like when they are trinkets and and oh i go there once a week once every two weeks to an end so they do stuff like in everything time of been there it's been one of these things ten to a six ten six rounds of ten minutes eat em thirty seconds in between one and then one minute between the next one you know to go sick or five ten mineros o four ten minute rent inaruna in one twenty minute round in those you get tired yes sure i have a conditioning because what god we do towards like when i'm when beans get ready receeve we got that's doing the longer or the no time on their match and not doing teniers twenty minute rounds i'm just good to go in yet not a right it had to holding a hand to her but i think you has to do with wire talk about the other day where i'm not a really fastest bring her i am not a really fast rather bestruck back on me i no for long time right and i think it's one of those i ingram for a long time he now ettie yes i think mine the collegial war if i know it's twenty minutes then i'm not i don't feel like i not come find or i know i feel that we all had to him to you the horse on west sharp tank each other i know you now you're put in you know i'll be the or one of our guys that's competing we'll go in the middle and you're getting fresh guy every yes you minutes one minute three minutes five minutes whatever the case may be you're getting somebody fresh on you and that's where you get that's we get tested yeh don't say tibullas though it say anywhere from a five men around six minute round either five or six minutes three four or four ropes i take out the tip italiano at not a training for a competition to the you know this what rejoin if you go for five six rounds that's like that's kind of a lot around compared to dust the average and i think it might experience yet i let i i sort i feel like i got i got good training yet like a six ix minton's when i feel good yet i thirty seven year it's almost forty forty something in it a training that makes you feel good even for ye that's a lot the thought the you know you'll see guys dropping on you after three rounds to it said ye not everybody huyot obvious are asked to wit who you training yes ye that me morrice train with some of this not a good all day long up were you in to sir ketten a grinder sonia ye get me ready what is it discanting with andy one round sees on on is like literally like three rounds with him like an average normal person on your level here and if i birthstate in the string which colburne was and is these these prime my maturing partner now goal the time ah but for a while he didn't work out at all he didn't like estray bright yet back in the day and i said any man you got to get to next i won't i hate to say it you've got to do some more and out you know and he's athletic guy and you ask and i just said i go do bunch pouponne iolanthe possums and debs on the next day to some squat on an essay he started doing it and in a month man he was a different due see had now we started power lifting so he and even he's even a more pinga little bit more but he's one of them big desonating turn in an got some game sure he did good and then in the challenge mademoiselle i i he took like second year or in some like to go he's drank out the yard yes funny he is m i noticed that where it hes always athletic and stuffed in one time i ain't seen him for not in that long but the like for weekdays ain't what you don't whatinell wait efferent now in use like oh i just changed to eating i don't eat like a whole a containers of nitella any more good gessenheit animal but you that's it next waited it can you please share on your pots what the difference between the lazy delegation and decentralization is okay sir disegaged his armies levison the principal's combat we have the book that we rode in i a very simple definition that i've been explaining to people be centralized command its every body lead that's a decentralized command as a and an obviously i mean you want everybody else to lee as a this question is with different seen being lazy and just delegating everything and what's good decentralization so lazy delegation number one is delegating things that are actually your job right cause there's there's a molder's possibility that people have to educate something that is supposed to be your job and you delegate it somebody else cause you don't feel like doing it then that's lazy if as a matter of fact if you're dating something that it's something that you're deleting because you don't want to do it then then that's being lazy right if you nacta delegating something because it's something you don't want to do then you're being lazy in an alte you it actually a mind set to take on the tasks of the things that you don't want to do or that your team doesn't want to do umtomie literally do elder or something that is hard to do or that no one wants to do do that thing and i give ye example we had to we had to stand watch in iraq on my first support we had to stand watch on the prisoners that we would capture through aback my have to stand watch on so i made myself and my assistant button commarin comment time i gave as i assigned us the worst watch of the night like the zero three hundred in the morning till zero five hundred a morning the watch that nobody wants because it's in the middle of your sleep pattern no one wanted that watch i put out on that watch we took the worst watch so i didn't delegate the hard watch i took the hard watching so there's an example of the opposite of being lazy and her taking on board the hard task you know another one is when we would go shooting and we'd get don't shooting in believing even the ill can you gotta go pick up brass you gave a pick a brass on the ground all over the desert all over the field all over wherever you did it unchasteness pretty easy from the guy that's in charge to have a meeting to his head so when a thunder pick up aspenwold always pick up rest you know i would rather leave shell this shelter he ether but a pain you know it literally at when you're at a land warfare it takes a couple of days to pick up brass and is that of like i said i and of having to go back for a meeting i'd go out there and you know jump in there and have the crap job like everybody else of picking up rest so i won't deligate these things that's being lazy when you delicate that ah and in another thing i'll find is as somebody's complaining somebody one of my subordinates is complaining to me about having to do something i automatically take it and i say o o echo is a pain for you to do this cool what i'll do it and he has a good psychological effect on her i am menisini each showing them benilo man i'm here for you and if it's too much for you i'll take it and i've had people literally got out her though i can cause that the instinct of people have they got to look marigot it you and that's what i would do if i complain about something and then i said and then my bosome you know what i touch for you i'll take care of it you like none of it he may do me ouatanon nasalities also a little for a discipline in there a little from dispoint of taking on board tasks and doing things that you know you don't want to do yeats a way of exercising some discipline in your life and making things happening so that's the kind of thing always things that that think a lazy delegation if you do in those kind of things where you're getting rid of jobs you don't want your giving rid of jobs that you should be doing and getting rid of jobs that are a pain or our monotonous or you think they're below you so that the opposite at his decentralized command right this is where your letting other people do at their supposed to do it's when you're letting people do things that will help them grow hum it help a person grow by picking up grass i suppose there's little character building and herodias not going to literally help them go see you to delegate that task but it helps some one grow as a leader to do this eurorie hundred is your five hundred watch on prisoners no it's pain it's just it's just unmitigated pain so it isn't help people gross said at that then then you don't have to decentlie that but if you got something to go let him to grow you let him do it if there's something that allows you to stand back and be the tact colgius and we were a lot of nabucco then an vervillin me to have a different perspective on something then i should absolutely decentralise that delegates so if if there was a mission came up and we need to come up on the plan i would tell you to planetiades and then you go plan it you'd be and volved in it and you lose the lopatin that i would have sohei come back to look your plan you say here's the plan i go ahead look good except to these two points and you'd be like man how to see those points it said gehazi had the altitude so that's another time that decentralized command it's a very helpful decentlie command to means letting people make little mistakes and not punishing them because of those mistakes that decentralized command if i just hammer people and punish them when they make a mistake they're not going to want an take the chances moronto take a risk and to knocking a one to lead you know hocus i've been puerility actions towards them now that doesn't mean and i've seen this happen that doesn't mean if i am going to let you go plantains and i see your screwing up on his going to let you have a catastrophic failure no amante a echo think about this a rare hacting about that over there will go get you dialed in i'm going to let give you some rope bannon let you hang yourself i'm actually go to give you enough rope to get the job done and think on your own but if you start looking like you're going to hang yourself on me a stop you the other thing about decentralized command that's positive that's not just lazy delegations when you let your subordinate lead so that you can focus of board outward and forward so if if we you have a mission if we have a mission to accomplish and i tell you to lead it that means you can take care of that mission i can look up word meaning up the canican find out on one of outward being with the enemy doing and forward meaning what's going to happen in the future and if i'm wrapped up in the in the accomplishing of the casket hand from a leadership position i can't do any of those things i can't look now for i can't look out we're lianor you got to let people read silet they can become leaders and your actual go and this is what people get intimidated is till to set them up sakina your job that's what you want you want them to be able to take your job and people get scared of that but you can't be scared o that ye will is that quileron the where where it won do to near the guy or something the way what happens if we develop you know our workers in the they leave us and you like it's better than not developing on real end avidum stay yet he had to get to i mean that's me your raging that you were ordering a cohabitant i'm saying yes no that's that's good in you definitely want o set your people up you want work yourself out of a job and then you've got to be you your other opportunities will come because people will see that you develop a team of people to see that you develop good leaders and there say he want you to come and do that at this higher position an you're goin to get you maneit from that as well well echo can you ask jocato talk more about the writing process in ups and downs obstacles daily reaches and or future plans a so i know i asked answered the casion before it's very ill i tore again am i to do quickly what will i what did i do when writing i wrote a thousand words a day no matter what if i had some obstacles as the question had said here i would write if i had up and down i would write if i had a daily ritual it was to write every day that's what i did i wrote a thousand words a day and when you're right now fifty thousand or sixty thousand word manuscript that means in two months you got your you got your manuscript done the thing about writing every day and out set this before is if you write every day you don't need to reach what you wrote before because you remember it even this open the book or you can open your page you can open the document that you can just start writing and you even i used to like kind of lead my leave from myself a lead sentence that i knew would just i could sit down the next day a start flow and right into it and so do that and also i had the outline i mean for remorse that lay in a row i had the outline we had the chapters so i broadly knew what i was right in about and then is just a matter of sitting down to make it happen and when i went to call hosanner college and guess what i sat down and rope when it me when i had to write papers when i had to write scripts when i had to write whatever i had to write i just sat down and started writing in and in it a same thing when i was in the navy the navy right all kinds of stuff you write evaluations you write operational summaries you ride a war you right all kinds of things in the navy and i used jussit down and write that's what you've got to do you shetet on it and what one thing about me is my rough draught my when i'm sitting on i just a writing it's i know it's going to be rough is going to be a rough rough draft that's what i'm going to write is go this go and i an't here and mispelling stuff in punctuations bad but i don't care about that iminent not is so easy to clean that stuff up later the hard bare getting the the the foundation all information down on the paper that's the hard part em and it's easy for me to edit it or on it later now as far as future plans future books a teeming lay in or definitely doing a follow up a book about the arshin where were working on it right now silentium i know that your text messages are always grammatically of correct yes i was a oislands major and i could a classis i could class is like advanced grammar and sinaian ah yes so it actually i find that language and linguistics to be very interesting and i know that a my trip strikes in people as weird but i really do i find linguistics and language and the written word in the way words are combined together to make fox in neeples brains the very interesting process to me if the guest i was ah i was very interested in it and that another reason why i by studied english when i was in college it's the it's the written word i you know it's the written a word which is a very very powerful very very baliol to elpenor over yousof capital letters in tecmessa's of abusting sometimes that's only when an tatavera in say next glacial see you on the latinet questioned juggle in detachment something you do in real time or the before or after any man i think i've heard you describe both is it be no it is not those i is not both actually it if you think about it okay that it answered they were talkin about is when you get involved in these situations you got it attaches from a so that you can make a decision that you can see things greyton access things clearly that's why you detach from the situations so technically if but four or after event you are detached from them it be could have her not happening at that now i guess you could be so emotional about an event that even after happens you could still not see it clearly because you can't detach him as right guess i could give it to you that okayannie so am up about it and so nervous and not it and so emotional about it that i guess before him you could so i guess i guess i am wrong i am talking about the catching foot the process right but even if you are if you have to detach beforehand you're not denoting on the incoming situation you have to be that from our current yes seeing nervous about the uncomeatable proper all talk about that a little bit but the skill itself is being able to detach during the event an i'll tell you once you do detach from it its actually pretty easy but to punch through otha gravity that your brain makes with a lotion and chaos may him that's the hard part the hopes and notice that you're stuck in the gravitational poor valeation so you got a pay attention that in and what you really want to try and do is trying it's what you do said trying to catch yourself the fur the gravity and the the gravity viloto and the cat builds up if you can detach before that then you have to break through it your already outside that realm and to it it's it's much easier so sectors quick sand and funnyman it's much easier to just see the quick stand and just say i'm not going to step in there than it is to walk in there go up into your waists and search feelings getting sucked down and then decide on in upon myself in but it's all a lot harder now so you got a look for those signs you got to look for that moment when you start feeling emotional you know that it's going to be something emotional you've got a step back from those in it did yourself in the habit of asking yourself what do i look like right now what does jack look like right now what does jocound like right now listen to yourself talk listen to the words that are coming out of your mouth and see if you be a reasonable human or not and i'll tell you one thing that i i do i kind of see is you know in em in the movies that terminates like the the various responsive i will when i'm when i'm really good in a in a very detached mode and i'm having a conversation with some one i i like see the options in my head of what i could say to him and i owe you a that'll make a mad oh ye that's too often to okay that lasted one hey bud of alma so i think that that mind set kind of works pretty good but again look for the signs look for the quick and look for the emotional quick sand and don't step in it the emotion of the anger the frustration there is little physical fine too when you start feeling sweat beating up when you start being hot like you literally start feeling hot that should be a big red frae ye that warm that flushes though your face that not good now the breathing we start getting when your breathing starts increasing your pulses going to tusuf you got a notice to say yourself oh there it is there it is that's the quick sand of a motion and confusion and chaos he don't want to step into it you on a pull yourself back will take away there is like be like the terminator and no i'm not saying the alinaunder that was a ah that was a comparison of a thinking of beable to visualize the option that you have and if you are emotional you don't think like that for your emotional you just use blurting out hanover is going to come out of your mouth but when you are detached a little but you alcaics as i could say that all this is an answer very and we asiliboiles salving yet tactic you in other you titinius on the terminator he blurted it out analytically he blurted out any motional response because he is acting like a person remember that remember said rigdon concernit when he is he's in the saying his locks all shot up and the the superintendent or whatever the whatever is not in on the motel doors or aviated cat and there what cause all these slashes right enough flyblock through response to an they're pretty funny if you read in my foretel what you are but he goes it that like pentecost tokelaus all those your littoral you now i do remember that yes that's pretty doll the fake emotions which sometimes which i talk about before somebody you got to use the fake emotions the switcher room ye or is that what's good for the goose's good for the now it's like a when you are kid is not getting you are not listening to what you're saying you're a having the impact you want a house you got a shortliner turnpike that's kind o good to an done crazy with it re is put with the kids were if you show anger not only is it like a powerful thing in there he like oh shoot this is powerful it demonstrate to them that you care about at what we're talking about renoitre about jaffery know rather than you know rosita just a machine a robot yes yes i don't care but i know i'm specially this kind of feeling next question how do you deal with being evaluated the sisily by different people with different opinions and motives or how do you deal with being in value well i can delrio nobody likes being evaluated right nobody now you might get somebody that's his own hitoban coach and jerosme people that are pretty pose about that and as matter fact i have clients were they want to be coached ring but most people especially nonoma environment like you got new higher some one to coach you okay but most people in a normal environment they don't like being evaluated they don't like being juntas judging it so the first thing you have to do when it comes to be evaluated is get that in your head that you like everybody else has defendemens and serganoff up as soon as somebody says something critical of you of soon somebody goes to a value it you your defense mechanisms are to go up and then one that happens when you feel those defense magnums go up you got to put your ego in check he got a poet your ego in shack and then once you do that you got to listen lis i know it sounds crazy plisent what they're saying don't even don't even think of a responses did you self now i'm not even in a respond i'm only going to listen to what their saying ye but in an toiney can't even take it none now i can't think it oh can them but i think mateo wild will quote unquote do that but they will really do it as far as i just i'm not consenting on the fimilian you there that that's actually like that matalista how they send up to go on or you say exactors caneless the exact animating about her you don't in order for all body language you know the ten were than i like you know they'll do that kind of oiliest bononia so to your right you got to listen and not just listen but truly listen not listen to with your ears but listen with your mind and i ran and with an open mind and an old pemine and then think about what we was in an ancestor tant see it from there perspective because you use it from your perspective our mat even seeing what the christ is rarely is your only seeing the defence of the griess actually get in their mind and say will what is this look like from their perspective why would they be taking the effort and the risk and the challenge of trying to present this problem to me if it wasn't important m arrius done it just to make me mad no be trying to help you and you know what just like just like a joke halliday like every joke has some little truth to it every little criticism even if the person is your arch rival their criticism is built on something of them so what is that reality that you can take away for a vegeto take it with a gratiously for person like an says here if the person has different opinions and modes well force they have different opinions an want people with different opinions may be they have different motives so maybe think they're trying to use sir feretory or something like that so you may be got to take it with a grain assault but find the grain of truth in there too and find what it is from their perspective what the problem at and learn from it and one of the most beautiful things about this is you take the crisis and you make a just and this you know how do i deal with a boat being evaluated i trying except the evaluation and make adjustments to improve myself as a human that's how i deal with being evaluated and i'm not saying that the a with anybody better than anybody else because everybody gets efensive myself included you know we had a little conversationally started to night right sir you said i remedies on the last pot cast a led justly and you know and then we got our it and then i said you don't any know i notice that your camerera a little bit i you don't do exist the pot my point was disaprove how defensive all get and all get and you know what i did i said you know what i noticed that too we know vetasta as me repeating there's a couple of the sections and it was because we pull i pulled from multiple different books and they had a little bit of overladen in and looking back on it probably shouldn't have put at the time i thought you know what this is emphasizing really important points ye but still people don't want to hear the same thing over overagainst shouldn't done that so guess what criticism excepted and i will adapt a just and i will make him prove once to my game based on your criticism of my technique my skill and my life a nitecap your consist the camel work no no don't you know you know anything but an erithraean or is outerwear you to tell me a tale or any field lothian's tell that go anything take their criticisms fixed the problem that's what it's all about and on to get better next wasted jackal echo what are your guilty pleasures other than venusian by the way i don't even like doucet's pure echo right there as you talk about yet the donative to it for limiting as the question what are you going to pleasures other than don at jackway do ye do when you momentarily give in to a vice or something that you knows bad for you meant her your high long i like the fact that the people that rasping his actually two questions in one mi appreciate the fact that this person says jocando when you loman terribly fond of indovini i appreciate that as if i am this person that could only for a fraction of a moment given to any form of vice because i am not a human eh so i agree that you know the part i appreciate what this to her son the first part asked both of us the civically jack and echo what you're guilty pleasures the second part as others or the second part as jose overtly excluding my neighbors cocoa do you when you momentarily gave into a vice or something that you and the way i see this is that you do something about it if you underly give in me if i'm on tally give in like no north of your my advisably doesn't work a cause is as you take it it's just being over at that for it is given over the fine or you could take it to the fact that they don't even think you ever break her as yet but then again you talk about indian sleeves or cookies on her so that's an issue ah but to get down to it like what are your guilty pleasures to guilty pleasures number one first and foremost meant chocolates i scream a anaspey mentholatum ice cream milk shakes and i do some twisted things in my brain to kind of convince myself that those are actually good for me in that they contain you just enough cars her approaching ernesta it's actually like a full good meal which is just the thing liebesverbot like a sullen right so but i do i do ah the oni love men choragi icecream ill i really love chocolate milk to m and and there's been these articles floating around me internetted for any hole eopepon you haven't yet tenthe thing it's like okay but the reality is its sugar and milk and and and so again i'll i'll twist that one in my head and sometimes for ten minutes i convinced myself that really that is the right thing to do in a i'll be see we've discussed on every for those little dam a prince wrapped hot dogs server i ordered have some kind of banter or something on him that just dan yes no i don't know who invented those things but god bless him and then you know you know the normal crab foods that the taochi the french fries the whenever the junk okay so am i i mun juve jennetin that human beings had been too through that make us desire sugary foods and the endurin going off in firemano one not amun of those things when i alte you when i do first of all i like her earnestlie eitelheimer under the backage one way or the other like ither bust did my ass and it did to completes an art work and out and all was sudden i you know am out with my god and worse swinging by and all of a sudden i see there's igspreshn of aretino what a let's get a aisgill ttle go time and and one thing i i when i do it i don't like to have guilt when i'm sitting on i'm not going to my god i can't believe in doing that is i know i say mad i said also in this i cream milk shake as gray and gray but later on dear that night or the next day i own that thing polonis ment and place little unity of reprimand for slack behavior who and a feather be careful of is that it is at liriope and as you mentioned like one potency can lead the twenty in it does lead the twenty and even that is like okay understand we had we added derailment right but don't let one day of bad food led to another day of bad food and no working out lead on that's what happens that's what makes you so foresail i mean there's like tempers got that thing where he does it something like six days in a row of eating super clean and medenilla actually is not just cheetal till like donkister it because your body asked to get the shock of cabs and all this stuff there's another big lie like you can tell you in twisted tsontowana to hers do this at his argonaut but you do have to be careful of the slipery slope that for me that's what has i think happens i think i don't believe in the stuff that you know you you use up your will power throughout the day and you use it your discipline i believe that you disappoint decisions create more discipline decisions now be if i do diabetes of a day or if i have let's say for one of resi have a two day just gluttonous train wreck ben shower i'm just where i just for whatever i lose the bubble you know and there could be anything any number of things that could cause that maybe you know what's a multiple i don't know bad situation with travel than with an event than with something that come on en it's a birthday party and eifelgebirge speed at on my gennettin it's just done right it is better to hope the wine yadetat if i do have nostos then all usually you react to that you know how arnette i'll if i go on a just a terrible food thing i'll do some kind of a fast i'll twenty four hour fast may be in a forty eight hour fast i hadn't done seventy two hour but on perenuius hour what do you just drink quater hegestrates tan just turn what i did the forty eight hour and is a section nothing it was like no problem no factor i didn't everything normal squatted when serving did you get to her as some guys on the mat and i said as i tugging airing arians an go to take some when we get done trained us after this on the second day of doing it and so we trained a bonbon you always no factor and he's at woolens'll me i said i haven't eaten for so forty at hours and i sent the ones trying to out and and i feel completely normal i so ah so that's it that's the one of things i'll be recovered cent kind of you know psych kind of hard corn work out um you know we a body in motion tends to stay in motion in a money at rest enestin rest don't let the moment them start going the wrong way you don't have men get that body back in motion did back on track snap yourself back in to the discipline you cross a work out get after it and get on that bath the bath of discipline and strength and stay there you mention the the keeping into the brain that you are evolved to have or whatever you know on tutie seeking out sugar on fat and you know fastnight but that's what you are evolved to to want and it's for reason so you know put simply back from your again van you didn't know when the next meal is coming from your soul you know if you you get that honey you are that no higher that that this much calories much as you can't use your brains till like that oh so a good tactic and i use this indiscrate crazily it worked it were for drinking no a mention to before oh where you just understand that your brain is in a way playing the trick on you and if you give in literally by this model you just felt for a trick and so now you know that right so you're your falling for for a trick that is played on you by your own brain because it thinks it's you're still a cave man so you see these donuts or cake i don't know pizza something delicious and in fat you mean what you had forgotten to night in this as i dinner and your bringing his islamisation got it honors birthday party it you got the family over what what are you going to do put them on a parody have for the evening well tell you one i into be tonic cream in its anger is the beck for echo terreckly those lunch and then had a salad for dedititii off see you this imitation on tetra yet like it but so if you you understand that you are you just fell for a trick it there um so not going forward you know we're okay if i have these cravings or you know that don't look delicious and we whatever we ah you're goin your bouteille and consciously fall for thick right out him there's some scarcity of food right now there's an abondance of food and you know it's a perfect woarse for this don't be a sucker yet i ahieser like like hell oarholes ignavos thing someone can tell you that a what i inherit o orsatto i worked for you eh don't be a sockless so don't be a soccer to that pecorain is trying to trick you ye in the waning stuff that's actually bad for you ye to it yet and so how the trick works is your brain is saying hey those donuts those are those are beneficial and look at all these bene like you'll kaoura calories they're onosander re goin to come that's at your brain is that's why how it feels the game can you ordered domino yes yes that's that's the reality but your brains not telling you that ere it's given you creased all those countries you know how it was going to come and look at all these benefits on to taste good and this is what you need that's what your ring is telling you this is what you need materiality as you on even that world any more where you can get as many don't use as you want now so it's tricky me into thinking that the short term benefits are the men of it when in reality since the world we live in now different the long term benefits of the benefits yes and they on involved on it or denikin don't be a soccer thought be a sucker ye it help it man it hell if you care about being a sucker thou that's the thing if you're like after about being a socinian there's no way in like i know not that all that's what i think too as that's the thing too i left fresh jocko is buds the right filter for the panope you want in the feel teams does it filter out good people and light in the bed so falahari under water demolition and seal training and it does be on job and i i'm not going to say that every body that makes you do bud as a guide that you want to work with or even a guy that you want on your team cause one thing that happens in buds is that punishment is dealt out right in its just suffering it is hard work and it's you know put in boon your head and being cold and wet and all this stuff and you either embrace that and crush it that's one way to get through that the way you should get through but there are that day they find the way to get by and to sneak by into work the system right it does happen and those guys definitely exists in the teams than the real team guides now those guys are but one thing it's hard it's hard for a civilian to to know the difference testolini he alasse or have you tried it you see you must be a that is the what is it like collie when your coach is saying okay buddy push it up for you know sixty seconds then you look at her on him when you see a lookin at you yet his kind a crush there is sanatan all kinds of gods as all kinds of little corners that you can cut their things get away with and the weird thing about buds is i think lay talked about this when he was on the pond castes or maybe didn't maymead conversations but you have a mentality when you're going through buds is that your your tenant you tryin to help every one get through and so you don't like rat those guys out as you cottians you you a very seldom do you rap one of those guys out in less is just a untruss case most a time guys are you know like he manolie alister's coming like hell helped people escape through a right so it's it's pretty negatively get through buds and you're in the seal panes then then you every one says to a man will say i wish i would help the anyone get through because now there intimes and now we can't count on them a yeah now we got to carry their weight so so so it is definitely a taste of making it through but there's two as to make it through you can crush it and survive it or you can see nettoient through in that does happen now it's also mainly a physical test and people talk about no it's mental its physical right that there's a mental aspect to it no doubt and if in if you not meant to leave a committed to make it through to its going to be hard for you but it's primarily a physical taste and physicality is actually a small part of being a seal now of course it's like a base line factor i mean it is a factor as a see got to be able to do the job physically but that's the base line right and being a good athlete is definitely the does definitely not automatically makes some one a great seal because there's guys that go through bugs that are stuck physically and we get the seal teams there are not good there not with tiles they they might be a bad leader they might be unsafe for they can't shoot an they can't handle the pressure when they can't handle the grind but he ague that's a elite level acts athlete and guess what he's in eustelle level of food he used to eleele of of treatments he's used to an eleele of rest and you usipians therenow life food there is no ellerments there's no even rest there's just cried and you out that desert and you're just go on on operation after operation of properties me of these high level athletes there's such a fine tune to machine it's like we talked about before they are like a poor shore race car which you want to be as a forbear but you can put besabeh into that engine is going to keep running have to put the high ten clean stuff inapire car and some of those guys break down on that and in it the reason is like i said is because the epeans is not bud training and i'll send me this before no one as you can cares about but strayline you gotten through buds it's like as normal as brushing your teeth like every one's done it no one said he did you pressure teeth no we all resorteth but not that big of deal um one can that blood does do good though as it does you good job of finding people's weaknesses and whether it swimming or whether it's running or whether it's e obscoose it or whether it's whether it's lack of sleep or being in the water in the water works that they make you do if you have a weakness of any of those areas it's going to it's gonna show misconna show but again some guys do find a way to make it through and they end up in the teams and they end up doing a couple of seal pitons but again being just being a seal doesn't make you back as that that's just betrothed doesn't make you a great leader it doesn't make you attack to call expert it just doesn't it means that you made it through the training and you survived a couple elton's that's what it means now there are plenty as eels that are bad as and great leaders and definitely some tactical experts button it certainly isn't every seal it cause there's a bell curve in the silence a belcher just like any other group of people or any other organization and at the comfortable curve you got a bunch of relentless unstoppable warriors that carry more than their share of the weight in the teams and ever the guise and that have built or are building the reputation that the selims have and then in a middle of the curve the tree got the bulk of the guys and is are great guise their great seals they do the job and they do it well in their appetising professional combat troopers who get the job an then they get a jar they get the jump down on time on tarkenham solid guys that maintain the reputation of the sultan they maintain it and then you got the crew at the bottom ones the guys that slip through the cracks they worked the system and while this technically classified to seals these aren't guyarre like respected the other guys in the sylphes in quite ourselves usually the guise that talk the most and brag the boast about being a seal and these are the guise that they don't build the reputation or maintain the reputation as healthiness the guys that live off the reputation of the seal times when in all likelihood they promptly haven't contributed anything themselves to that reputation leeches but that is what it is and anatoly say the team is gave me everything the good the bad and the ugly and i wouldn't i want jane to think i love this you'll taste frog man the a w gunner in a seal petulant man the cormarants the rear security the potion g and the elbe and the oise in the ais these giese guys in a seal patton the one that carried a weight and gariach los guys are in my blood i love those guys are always well okay locustidae what is discipline really mean you'll be side to wake up early in how do i employ it to all asked that of my life what is it ready mean the s disappoint it it does start with waking up orly really does but that is just the beginning and i was say that discipline is the row of all good qualities but yes to absolutely apply it to things outside of just waking up early it's it's everything it for an out every day making yourself stronger and faster and more flexible and healthier discipline is even right food still fewer system it it's about disciplining your emotions so you could make good decisions it's about having the discipline control your ego so your ego doesn't get out of hand and control you to mount treating people the way you would want to be treated in and doing the tasks that you don't necessarily want to do but that you know will help you or i help your team to facing your fears dick discipline to face your fears so you can conquer them and that's what discipline is discipline means taken harrod the upper ad to do what's right for yourself and for other people is so often the easy path the easy path it calls to us to be weak for that moment to break down for that moment to give in to the desire and the short term gratification but the discipline of will not allow that the discipline calls for strength and fortitude and will i will accept weakness it won't tolerate another break down the discipline in semi like at your worst enemy but the reality is is i plan is your best friend it will take care of you like nothing else can and will put you on that path the path to strength and health and intelligence and happiness the most important it'll put you on that path to freedom and i think that's always got for tonight so thanks
