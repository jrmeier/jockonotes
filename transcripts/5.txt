this is jacopo asked number five with echoes and me joaille giddying echoed carl city men welcome to pagasaean you ye are here we are number five thank you every one for joining us so to night i got asked on to winter it a cold you talk about coaching some people and that kind of prompted me to think about something that i have pulled out in the past when i'm teaching some leadership classes and what this is is to counselling no that i wrote for sessions when i was trying to help a couple of seal leaders in provensals and get better and the first one was for a seal that was a buddy mine and who was a little bit junior to me just a little bit junior in me in rank but you know because i was a prior and listed seal i had actually britoness for a much longer time and this guy was a regret great leader great guy and very passionate about dona a solid job in very passion about the celtes which is an awesome thing to see and with that passion and i've said this before sometimes your strength can be our weakness and sometimes you get a little bit to passion about stuff in a little bit emotional and be be a little bit easy to read and so i was in a meeting with him and i can asa i rosacea how other people were reacting to him and so he i saw that i kineton and just put the words on paper to let him know that he had it area improvement and whisked about this as you know i was the detached person so i was able to sit outside the situation as in watching see oh that's that he not coming across the way he thinks he's coming across and so restore off without one is pretty positive echo when land was then when you think put were on peristalick enough ficial thing you all like when you get rubrius at work or something it's like yours or disintering right this one was not this was just a brow saying a man to hear some years in tips all think a deal note almost ye not ye this is a deal o noise what's interesting as he thus it there is in the seal pam there's not a lot of writing up ought inness in this capacity so alias a safety violation where they do something on safe they can run up immediately but this type of thing is a little bit you know because normally you just trying to bring some one along and help him out and improved at leasht you know it's just venturing so a lot of times at billy to document when you're trying loutherbourg that's why kind of lucky here i forget what it was but i you know i went to meeting he was in it and i kind of forget the situation but for whatever reason i wrote this down and i think i sent it to him and to day looks takauti later but just just want to give you this stuff you know now and some i'm kind of lucky that i wrote it down is condalkin the spirit of organisation yeah and just i think it was more of just i couldn't talk to him immediately right whatever reason is a desateful loftus why like left him on his desk i forget foodie's probably mail but so here we go and there's there's some interesting comments in here an that's why i think i saved it and that's why i think it's it's good conversation so he re go hears my note to a seal leader that is it body trying to tiamo along his leadership paradise and here we go one leadership is getting people to do things this is a form of manipulation so right there i use this word that everybody hates manipulation and people often replace that word with influence and i do it to you know i all you want to use your influence to what were your really saying you want to manipulate people but it's very negative and the way break that down the war separate that from something negative something positive as if i'm trying to manipulate you in a negative way and means i want you to do something that's going to benefit me in cretyne that's manipulation that's negative riferince em on your crenelate you're still manipulating them but your trying to get something that's going to be positive for them and positive for the team is so as far as i'm concerned when you're influencing some one you're really manipulating for a pause about come so but that being said i think people need to recognize that and that's why you that word because every one knows women ilation's your trying to get some one to do something and that's what leadership as if you figure out of your trying to get some one to do something but i use that worse is a very clear what you're trying to do leadership is nothing more than getting people to do what you want both up and down the chain of command so not just to be able blow you want to people above you to to do what you want them to do more importantly getting them to do to want to do what you want them to do is the best form eliashib and the highest form of manipulation to the situation where beaten you you want the person just a want o do what you're getting them to do in so now i go on every time we open our mouths to speak to another person or goals to get them to do what we want them to do otherwise why the hell we talk so everything you say the tony your voice that the words you choose the inflection on those words and body language and face expression are all tools to be used to make progress in getting your way or two that you miss you and isolate yourself and move away from your goals so again i wanted to make sure that this guy knew that every little face expression everything that he said and how he said it all those things have an impact as people forget that you realize how and portoro arm and how important you facileness ions are and how important your tone is an how that impact people you are always in negotiation everything you say and do and the manner in which you say and do it as an impact on future outcomes priciple now is is when i say this to people a goose here is the best weight of wind is when the other person doesn't know you won and if possible might not even know there was a fight if you're eagerquietly the constant food a victory you can never win in this manner so just a restate that the best weight a wind in a in a competition of getting some getting something to happen of getting some some one do something the best way to win us when they don't even know that you want and even better than that is that they don't even know that there was a game they don't even know that their doing this for a reason other than by their own free will murat's what they think that's what you want them to think and again this is manipulation and i'm sorry about that the thing is is that your manipulating for positive outcome you're not manipulating for your own benefit you're not manipulating for to you make that something bad happen a person you're influencing them so that they do a better job to teem does better so that mission gets accomplished now i go on create advisari or antagonistic relationships never helps you reach and goes this is slightly related to the old keep your friends close enemies closer people that outright a pose me will never help me and will usually maneuver the hurt my cause this is never good at least a nettion ship seldom results in some one actively savaging my efforts so it's really easy to get an adversary i relationships and that was one of my little go to words and i used to use when talking to my sportiveness was added the fat misrelation ship is not to have you started get to an adverse elation ship with a person and wares that going to go and i would say it never goin to be good and never can to their never going to go out of the way to help you in fact when you are an adversary somebody they go out of the way to sabbatian hurt you and that's that's just never going to be helpful so nagamasa your history reveals that you are good at getting into adversarial situations you should work to control that imponit will never help you attain your goal and a that's the you know your laughing because as a very blunter that's a very blunt said it your history reveal that you are good at getting into adversarial situations so good at it though it gillamoor real good at it you um and you can see this is this is pre blunt ah put preparing here and the reason is can i had a relationship with a god you know he was open to hear what i had to say and so it wasn't like i was just being a jerk and i was going to put him on the defensive and he knew that and he knew that i was always you know look it out for his best interests and i knew he would look out for mine as well so we had a gregorio ship going out don't burn bridges period nothing is ever gained by this the future is never known and i always do what i can to keep lines of communication open bridges and tact and reinforced if possible so why burn bridges so seldom in life should you burn a bridge and a lot of times people think because ammond am agressive that i i'm like this kind of burned bridges typepaper son right and it's it's just not true because it's not an effective way to go through life now i go on to make a note about that i don't like to say never but when dealing with human relationships which are inherently complex in the unpredictable i believe that you should never fall courses of action that cannot be undone reversed or manipulated in the future of course now in facing about you know people on the same tea a ma thackin about you know going to war and there you obviously do things in war that he completely unaversal because you are destroying and killing people they are never coming back so this is different this is this is an a team situation we are trying to work together in your ear telesippe going on believe in what you're saying but except that you might be wrong i believe in what i'm saying and if i don't believe it i study and question ate until it makes sense or i change what i am saying until i do believe it but a little harder derstand that last piece so so at him saying as you gotta believe what you're saying you have to believe what you're saying any if you don't believe it then you've got either a question whatever it is that you your being told to believe or that you should believe that you're supposed to believe you got a question that until you understand it and then once you understand it then you have belief it and you know i am not going to go into crazy detail on that because i in our book the that later i wrote you know there's a chapter and it's called belief and in explained exactly what i'm talking about when it comes to making sure that you believe in what you're saying but i think the point that i was focused on here was more that sometimes you wrong and you have to be able to admit when you wrong and i i go on to kandogori if i'm wrong i look forward to admitting it because it gives the opportunity to advertise being humble and open minded that's interesting and people missed that opportunity all the time when the wrong neider put their front down and deny it or they don't take advantage of the fact that they got that that win the wrong they say oh you know what a conan i i'm definitely wrong here i think you had a much better idea let's i'm stepping back and you run with it that's a great sin i ain't it makes people respect you go at it cool that's gun this guy is humble enough to admit when he's wrong and they like that so that actually a form of manipulation and his own rights he could i want you to think that i'm a humble and i am able but i want to make sure that you see that when i go on to tell this individual you are not good at being wrong partaking criticism is the weakness of ours so recognized fool and again you can see the earth the tether that cineration ship at aviemore already really put that day another regard this is written i would say maybe eight years ago some like that dispersion for computer cause we have you know a record of things or red saved it right into asia for sure now i go on think strategic you will win and lose daily battles all the time if you flaunt your victories which you do they hurt you strategically if you so in your defeats which you also do it hurts you strategically this is wrong winning in daily battles gives you the opportunity to deflect credit show your humbleness and victory and show your ability to lead which all help you in the long term fight to achieve your goal losing a battle gives you the opportunity to genereuse see dear position to admit your wrong which both display humbleness and display your ability to follow so people every business and every job in in life in your house you win and lose little battles all the time and deciding which ones are worth fighting for number one and then when you do win them how do you act and in when you lose them how do you act in all of these the winning in the losing is not as important as how you act upon winning or losing and how you you ed continued influence a situation even though you might have lost you do it in such a way that you showed you milady and you open up you show your open mind and it makes the person you build your relationship with a so waiting or losing is not important what's important is how you react to winning and lose ye like when you uhlik when he say your sorry right you all like if he to people in a relationship or even friends and get into an argument fight whatever about whatever and in one person made a one to say their sorry in all because idle show that i was wrong or it'll show that i lost argument or show that my points were invalid or whatever they think but when you say sorry and ferries sorry don't be like one's garif you were a bended don't say that can stuff don't be like home consort don't say like that like really mean it and when you can do that in it consistently it'll be any future argument it'll start to break down that barrier of of of defence you know so they the persons who people both of them won't go into it thinking okay i got i got a mount this defense against this person now it can be a little bit more boofer problem solving situation more so than this argument means to contrasted not can you know get attacked if if they show weakness or whatever if they're like only you know what i know i i i made a mistake very good they you demonstrate by things are you demonstrated that you're not going to go and turn up the heat when they start towin that weakness it's like onkyodo can fall from lot more easy that's that's thinking sitee right right speaking to people going on here speaking to people oh wait a goldback i say you have a bad tendency to get caught up into act o battles you expand affordin ammunition received wounds and tear yourself up when you should be strict thinking should dedicate kind o goes to what you were to say we people will get all angry and no heart that relationship why because they want to win this meaningless battle right meaningless batable so detach yourself we start feeling that anger that a grecian that frustration did taters and ask her of a water i really argue what is happening right here why am i getting worked up you probably shouldn't be now going to speaking to people literally speaking to people treat everyone was respect from e one to o ten yell he wanted the military the lowest ranking burson o ten an officer ten is the highest that would be an admiral or a general that ye want is the is the seaman reclothes lowest rank persome thing trevert speak with humility this disarms people and is one of the best forms of manipulation in any gain if everyone is is put off by that term manipulation which i know it is a very derogatory turn me and but yetive because you have to understand what i'm trying to san fontenaye sure that people understand that when you are a leadership position there is nice ways of saying it but what you're trying to do is get people to do what you want them to do that's what lorship is and at also women if elationes m disarmed people are opened suggestion overconfidence and condescending tone which is common for you causes defenses to go up and people to get defensive so the minute you come in and you start being overconfidence of people in a condescending manner they get defensive and all of a sudden e not really listening at being said sol confidence and believing in what you were saying as no eave allow people to also believe in what you are saying and that they trust in your judgment and leadership however do not speak as if you know things your poet does not that offend every one especially seals so never never like talk to people as if you know something that they don't you know because it offends people it offends me i find everybody it's impossible not to be offended by that we make you feel stupid you get defensive so well you got to say things in a man that you don't sound like i know it and you don't i your rank means nothing in an argument pulling rank in any way is defeat so the minute i have to say echo i outrank you therefore right means i mean i couldn't means my augment and makes sense it should be able to stand on its own two feet a ensilage to that and this is something we we saw on this you will seem any set of hot the business world is well it similar rank it's the experience of pulling the experience caratapona experience card is weak arguments should be able to stand on the roan without needing to be backed up by the way we did it in bagdad the way we did it in remote the way we did it in afghanistan or on ever the case may be you shouldn't need to say that now you can sit in example but that should be the basis of your argument and we should that abusin ess world where some one will say well we've been to this before me and well why did you go through before i why we going through the dentify went through before maybe i did something wrong but that's a tendency that people have an indivisible you end up with people in a benitiers ry for twenty thirty forty years and so it's very easy for them just a fall back on the whole the way we done it before i've seen this a million times i was done it i've done this before i been through it for you for all reexamines is what people do also like if people there in some kind of debate argument about a whatever solicitously oh i have a college degree almost like my argument is better than yours regardless of what it is because i have that college degree ye i have unexampled of that where a young seal was feeling as if he was being disrespected about what that he no very much is it pretty new seal and he fell back on the argument exact rage said i was like you know i haven't i have a green problem solving or something altimeter on binoculars is on from all the goutais reason why people should listen to him we which is not a good card to pull out no he nantesian inannellata been a chi'en to a class on from solano need to listen in the wait a second one you just present your solution and then let it stand on his own to feet because if you're so good a problem solving than we surely must have a wonderful solution yet you think that clash atribute yes it's the same thing so to close this thing out i said anyway those are some thoughts i thought about this to day after we had that conversation i left thinking about my principles of management leadership off the battle field in administrative situations these are the same principles are used in combat building relationships and leading and i also used them in administrative leadership situations and as you know i've been successful matiniero en as well you're a great leader just make some adjustments to your game and you will be even better and let it that's how i closed out to this guy who as you know got this note for me and hit me back and say hey man thanks that's good stuff and and i'll take action then definitely improved his game with it now it's a pretty nice counselling session or nice attempt to help somebody now this next example that in the gorgias somebody that was on his last legs he was in a leadership position and he was having some significant problems now he was an inexperienced guy and for some unknown reason he was cocky he was arrogant he was failing as a leader and he then threw multiple verbal counselings like a thought about you as we do we ride people up i mean the sepentining somebody up for a lorship problem they've been counsel is omeros times verbally because you don't expect me not that part you know not that hard to say he make this suggesteth i was all yekdans that i was doing that the only time you owned up with some one that you have to actually write it down as when some one you start getting to a point where you say ay this person's job is now in jeopardy and this is a again thanks to technology i i saved this tootie so here we go seldom do i have to do this most guise listen and a just and get better and move on my contra meaning that the training crew that i had my country and your leadership asked that i talked to you and it is my job and my duty and my responsibility to try and make square away tactical seal leaders no this i have personally worked with and seen all kinds of petunias with all kinds of personalities if you count my previous experience in pucoon and training sell and as an enlisted man the number is pretty big i've done seven to ployments serving in every spot from the youngest a three new guy to the oldest and attacking a commander that being said i'm not that good at anything but i am a hard worker i don't like to waste my time with people that don't appear to have the desire to be better seals and you don't appear to have a desire to improve yourself despite your history which includes the following getting bad fit repo fit raps as short for fitness reports and that's basically in a valuation and this guy had brilliant evaluation to like general valuation on the lafittes its fitness fitnesses like one block but there will be block on leadership though we amocuna goallege they'll be there so there's all these baron his men heen bad fitness repointed a valuations getting sent to a staff billet as a junior officer so they took him and instead of making him in putting him a seal poltoon they had of in some administrative job which is a big signal some himself do that in between tours or after you do an assistant button commander toraylach that to expand your knowledge but he just got put straight into that so that wasn't good and finally having a horrible reputation in the teams which this individual certainly did have now i go on and say i didn't take this into account when looking at you as a sea officer and as a man i don't care what people say i judge people on what i see with my own eyes at first i thought you were just another alfama seal that rather people a wrong way no big deal they are plentiest feels like that i usually like them most of my true friends fallen that category and i was one of the things about this guy you know you was like a big guy and he was pretty gressie and i thought to myself just what i sent a tonkawa maybe he's rubbing a people wrong way and and people are lotioned by that as time passed i began to see something different this is what i see you are in secure about something i don't know what but it forces you to act arrogant and come across his selfish your performance as a tack called varies between below average and average with some visible spikes of increased potential you're almost incapable of communicating with other people respectfully so those topright there for whatever reason of that and never figured out what made this individual so insecure i don't know if he i i have no idea i don't know what happened to him but it's okay we have in securities we get intimidated we feel like we have to over prove ourselves took it be sin happen he just make adjustments that's all you got to do you got to make some adjustments you got to realize that you're not communicating with people respectfully and when somebody tells you that you're not the guy question what do i sound like maybe you pull out of of a recorder and listen to yourself you have some good ideas you have some good ideas from time to time but you act as if you know everything all the time your ability to elevate your presence to that of a respective leader of men on the battle field and in garrison is a most non existent and i don't know if at this time i was really using the term like detach that much but that's what i was trying to get to get across him is that he was able to elevate his presence he wasn't able to come across like a leader he was right there in mentally with the rest of the tugong on you cannot master emotions and you don't understand the ramifications of that short fall so these are the little things the little eye roll the heavy sigh the crossed arms i mean just all these little things that it was like it was like an open book when he see this go you know exactly what he was thinking and he had no idea that it was so obvious that rybody else myself all the rest of my instructor staff he has leadership every one was thinking the same thing and in his mind he was good to go he was you know he was a stone place poker player yet i candages worse on you can't masteuein but your emotions are reflective of your insecurity which you mention to one of the first things so it's like this double amy it's one thing if you can mascarati but you're pretty humble and in general and your nice guy or whatever you are though with gogetter and in the the emotions that you're not masking or something polonian puseyism negative but he look no one perfect hanafin but yes it's just like in security sinadone insecurity was really the what use out of him was i know everything you don't know look jack i know you've been in the team here he ten years and you done multiple pointed so received and even he i have done this europians overseas i know more demorest you we go on and and so now i start trying to make sure i comfort all the bases with a scoure you do not have the understanding of human nature kembing leadership influence manipulation compromise and a broad concepts of tactical operation operational and strategic leadership in management perhaps you don't have the intellect to understand these things because if you did why we sitting here right now talking about this in my theayter asonis is written down i rode it down and then brought him into my office put it in front of them and i read it to him ease wanted to be crystal clear me and so that's why this is written in that perspective them saying why are we sitting here talking about it right now why am i not thinking this might not be the most polished gun the world but easy good guy and i'll get things done because you you and i with plenty of seals that are just there just not that polish to the little rough round the edges of the camp brief well whatever i mean it's cool there's there's all kinds of different dies in the selfish and you just got to take what you get you you strength your weaknesses a little bit but this guy was just not getting there for some reason do you believe that you are a victim that people don't like you or have an out few in this was so weird miss gay had this attitude that ever you want want or to fire him that everyone was against him and he was this he was in this know struggle on his own or in the world and it was completely not true especially in the inner man obviously escalated to that but that he brought it upon himself but but honestly that something i kind of i kind o pride myself in in as a leader in taking a a blank slate when i meet somebody and say no cancoillote this guy's about repetition whatever i'm on amsonia to make him better i kind o take pride in that and an annamale people better and to frame to think that i was out to get him on the strain anterieure him ojus not true just completely not true ah this is not true but it isolates you first your ability to interact with people and keeps you in a paranoid guarded and confrontation states is arrogant you don't understand the broad skills required to be a good seal leader such as tact tebidi communications and trust building so it's interesting none of this is about fire manoeuvre none this is about the taking down a building none of this is about you know how to how to plan and execute an assault m none of this is about that because that stuff is relatively easy siderin what we would ninety nine point nine per cent of the time when we fire a leader had nothing to do with their tactical prowess and had to do with them as a leader now temiswaer affect would affect the tact glaucome of operations for sure but that wouldn't be the de key imponent of their failings lindheimeri failings would be their ericaceoe on you do not understand the burden of command you not understand the influence you have on your men this is a big one this is one of those ones that i i'd find this with so's i find this with middleage s i find is wever they don't understand there in fuente on their people and her stand when they say something off the cough that everybody's listens and they think they mean it and it has real impact on people in erstand when they show a late now being made it okay when they go home early going home early is o katterle little things examples of little things that people don't understand the influence they have now on their troops going on you do not understand the gift you have been honored with to lead men in combat against our nations sworn and emes my concern is how you will act overseas when lives are estacion allow you to go forward with these short falls and that is something that in the seal teams so as you can people think looms no good you desire him that's it and the actually not true you know you have to have good reason and document what issues there having and the other thing is that that's really harsh about firing somewhat of the celtis when you fire someone in the seal teams you're ruining their life if their dream to be a seal now in ocumare there pay check their retirement i mean they've got plans they their counting on this to when you fire some of the supineness ating career blow in a coneiferae now there are times we go haunt this guy could be okay will you push him back a little while and go recycling to come back and he'll get better esteemed more in that happens as well but in this type of situation this guy was already with a bad reputation this was going to be if he got fired from this job this was going to be a death sentence for his career the when you fire some one from the field team there not out of the military territon the situation in yet i sometimes they they'll get it wodeneshe officers will be removed from the military the less i guess might go to the regular navy ages at which is a harsh punishment for a guy that's been in the cultivate yoke in the selinga quite a bit of freedom you get more money you do in some job that you really like that almost unhurt doing the job in your like in that can be a severe form upon ishment as well is he is eligito the miners from the major lead said no politest you said totally different job it's like going from baseball to something completely different i mean it's gone from baseball to don accounting you know or from baseball to going to construction you know this that regular navy has regular jobs that are like that there's accounting jobs there's building a job there's you know technic technical jobs so it's like going from a job this eastart bewhich is the seething a job this more of a job was not like a definable discharged at usin no not a most reas any otenti i i remember was one a lomasha one time and the waves were big and it was cold and we were launching off this ship in the middle of the night and there was his regular navy guy a first class bosinney which means you know he ran and the deck operations of the ships and put in boats in the water and an hosautos and darkened were on his little boat down the middle ocean were about to go watch and ah the guy says to me man i would never want your job and that's you know that's a you thinking and i look back at him and i said to attoo because i would never want yours either because i would never want to be you know stock on a ship and do that kind of work but it's we both had jobs that we like iourneies got jobs they like but so when it persons in this you will seems though they're getting put you a job it's normally job that they don't really like m ah and what my point in all that he is that it is difficult to ruin some one's career in and it is a heavy burden when you have to do this to somebody that being sad you're going to send these people especially a personal leadership position there going to be overseas and responsible for people's lives you have got to do the right thing and i say that to business leaders now you know you've got a do everything you can to mentors one and that's that's that's actually how i know you've done everything you can to mentorian along because when you fire them you shouldn't feel guilty about it and when when a leader is all real affilata out firing this person okay the ateneo haven't done everything you can to men to the cause if you have and they still fail will the heir incapable of doing the job and and they need to go find a different job or then we get put in a different position that's this the facts but if you've done everything you've can and they can't do it then the lenman but when you go oh i want fitful bat an i'll get rid of this person's cause you say you haven't had this conversation that i have with this garret here a lane it out and saying here is what you're doing wrong here is how you need to fix it this is what the expectations are if you don't meet him you're not going to be here one to clearly understand the yet really puts a into perspective ration that last item there one when you said my concern is how you had act overseas when light threats dancali that really puts it into perspective of that for any really looking at it in a light hearted kind of way you can kind of compare this to let's say i when you're in kindergarten you get a report card whatever and then at the end if you're a kid like this guy so you get a little note at the insists that all is as does not play well with others for you like a young doesn't know it nesher the lapaca when it is this is the adult version of that but times it by like ten and it's some it up right here with a last one like when literata and not exactly what was going on the show her i tried to give this guy corrective measures as what i called it corrective measures numerant be humble and we get asked all the time with the most important characteristic of a leader and lariella all took time humility and an if you're not humble then how can you look at yourself and say o de stuff better how can you look your team and say we need to get better how can you look at your enemy and say i'd better respect them if you don't have that humility you're going to fail there so my first correct of action of this guy be humble number two truly and deeply accept the fact that you have some serious personality defects that you need to immediately put in check and over the long term completely fix so i was very concerned that this guy was going to sit there and not his head yet olga up sorry but not truly and deeply except the fact that he had these issues because there's a big difference between don your head and said you are got you sir okay sir yaysir almondine do better there's a bigger i see that and going home well looking in the mirror and sang i've got some serious problems that i need to fix going on understand that the criticism you are hearing from me is not mine alone but also my staffs and your leadership as well i have also heard this from other people outside your command your reputation is horrible again i the i wont make sure that he didn't think this was just jocko being postle i wanted to realize it was my entire staff and his leadership that was being cost going on corrective measure embrace and contemplate the solemn responsibility of being a selover about to lead men into battle and possibly to their deaths and brace the burden of command this is one that for me was very disturbing to see because i had let mananaun i had had my gussetted so have him with this attitude where i could see that didacus brain he didn't understand that these guesthouse to be in charge of he's goin to be asking them to do things that could get him killed and don't think he understood that but burdeen that's the burden of command that that heavy responsibility and yes in combat it means gueselin wounded or getting killed and that is a heavy burden but i will tell you in the business world when you've got people jobs at stake when you've got the profitability or the survival of a company at stake and dozens or hundreds or thousands of people may or may not have a job if you don't do your job correctly as a leader that is a heavy burden as well going on be the best at everything you do in doing that one put everyone else before yourself portway compliments shift them to your peers and your men except responsibility of failure and short falls only for in them is the improvement and growth so this is actually somersat ion we had on one of our earlier pocas any compliments success you shift that to your peers and your men nor accept the responsibility for the failures in the short falls and again if you don't accept the responsibility for those failures into repose how are they ever going geeche answers there not i never conochar everything anything if it's all i got fault i did everything right it's all at his fault no truly listen and try to understand what people tell you by first understanding that your personal compass is wrong truly and completely wrong for what is right and wrong for what a good seal and a bad one is for what makes an exception on leader and a horrible one you must correct this compass so that it may guide you in the right direction in my point with this was that i think in his mind his vision of what a quotannis i think he thought he was being it and i had to explain to him that he was wrong he did not understand what a good seal was he did not understand what exceptionless he just did not understand it you must correct this compass so that it may guide you in the right direction the final corrective measure lose your ego the sky disiato us record and a horrible reputation despite that for some unknown reason but i cannot fathom he had a big ego i thought he was a great seal he thought because he was a big doanou shoot well he's he's a talent that athletes well but he thought that that made him a good seal and it didn't it just gave a big ego so now i tell him these are tall tasks but you control them all and that's true you look at every one of those things be humble yes he controls that except the fact that he is need some serious work yes he controls that understand that the criticism is coming from a bunch of people not teme yes that's under his control embracing contemplate the sole responsibility of being a sealer bound to lead men into battle and possibly to their death yes he controls that of deity be the best that everything you do yes that's under his control so all these things logico these are all things that he had control over we need good aggressive leaders in the hiltons we don't need the person that i outlined above and the reason i pointed that out this because i think in this guy's mind he was an aggressive guy any was a good leader in his mind what i wanted him to know that yes we do need agressiveness and silted n't need this guy wearing the gay that i'm just talking about it's in your hands good luck then i asked him you have a question to commons for me which he did not i asked him are you sure he was sure i asked him if he understood and he nodded his head and again the reason reading these giles my actual notes and then i said do you believe i am right or do you just think i don't nor you think i just don't get it and that you actually know what's up and he of course said no i understand and even as he was saying moors i was not convinced and this gentleman did not make it he and his leadership roane ended up getting fired when he said he in that end of tenwa that like was the all salty like he understand no i mean he was he was not a disentis not openly disrespectful and may be somewhere in his brain he was trying to understand and trying to listen and trying to believe but the it wasn't there and so in goitrous and i think one of the reasons why i wanted to do this on the pot cast was it a lot of times leadership is about awareness and i used the example all the time in the movie terminator it says you know in the year twenty sixteen the machine speaking aware and i used to get to see that with sleds like they did become aware of being the leadership position and so that's it one form of awareness and i think a lot of times you don't recognise if you're not aware of something you can't recognize what the problem is in and so going through this all these issues that this guy had i people that are listening this podcast you don't have all these issues it's impossible you won't even like to listen this pocasse this is upon cast where were all kind of sitting here picking ourselves apart and see what we could do better in trying to learn and and people with with this type of attitude this guy had they they don't even enjoy this he they think they know everything now you atven talkin them that i'm not even thoughtout everybody myself included i still go through this and i go i'm do not little bit right there i'm fallen into that droundin little bit er again on this thing i'm doing this rag i'm not i'm not i'm letting my motions out too much i get i'm not the want people to be roots but you can't be in emotional disaster or emotional show for your people so that awareness in thinking about it and the other thing this is the other reason why one can use this particular note is because i think it's as direct of a note i i could write some one at maybe i could do better now i don't know but at the time to go face to face is someone and and kind of call em out this is about as stern as i could do it and this is the standard that we need alertest that sternness that what am i doin wrong and how i be honest with myself and be my own worst critic which is a big cliche but naberhood look at yourself and you can't be your own worst critic if you don't detach missasagos if your inside you had you can't even contageously gotta get out of that brain and it's going to be a common theme furgot just for this show not just for this pages but for effervescent one was things at you really helped me and i think has helped the people that i've worked with when they when they overcome that so there are some counseling for everybody myself included as are now were beginning to the internet questions so again if you listen this pot cast and you're wondering where these questions come from they come from a couple of rent places on the internet face book i actually get most of them from twitter ah you if you want to see what's happening on to it or with me it's a jackall in if you want a see ye what's happening on twitteration echo charles and if you want to he with aproned also if you want us submit questions then for me towardes the place to do it because i can jump on there you that means you have to be disappointed keep your question short and i just dragged the questions out of there and and put him into the well of questions and with that in some of my answer you know ritter on the spot some of em i too that that's a good topic so with that mind and and i'll tell you this is still from the well of questions where most of these i don't have the name of the person because i'm still on the well of questions of the first time i asked my got hundred requestin some still going through those and here we go what drill view to become an english major in college is is something i surprisingly get asked a lot and i guess it should be that surprising because if you don't know my story with college i was actually already in this hiltes i had spent ten years in this yuilles when i finally got sent to college i had to get a college degree in order to continue my career as a seal officer and when i went to college it was not even a question that i was going to be an english major so why is that well luckily i had spent enough time in the sultans to realize that the most important skill from an officer perspective that can differentiate and make you do a better job of something you could emmy with our oleariam and and the different points humility and disposal most things that make you could lead her that's great but those are things that you learning college so which skill could i learn in college that will actually make me do a better job as a seal leader and i knew before even showed up there exactly what that was going to be an that was english why well english to me was the study of the english language the english language is the methodology that we american humans used to communicate with each other and as a leader it is critical that you have a good control and a good grip on this medium that you're going to use to communicate what your vision is what your ideas are what your strategies are what the orders are you have to be able to do that in clear and concise language and i knew that english would provide you a that you also have to be able to understand what you are being told to do or what the orders are what the mission is or things like rules of engagement to ruling agement is a legal document written by lawyers and you have to read it and understand it and i found that this was very very useful this was probably an again looking back cause you know what i guess i could have gotten to gree in history in a con billy drove down to nosrat where be helpful as well but the practical application of english in that job was very important and all tell you that in any one that's goin t happen leadership position the command of the english language is a very important thing and when i started to get into shakespeare and shakespeare nother's at least half the audience just went out god wot is he talking about shakespeare the thing about shakespeares and this is what i had to learn in college when when you first see shakespeare you think oh i don't understand this that i this is a bunch of gobblegoose sound like in this i onunder stand it you're not supposed to understand and people don't take up a shakespeare play and just understand it you have to study what the words mean the guide made up words these made him up so how can you know what i mean you you lying if you say not temehani up he used archaic words that our words back than that were our cake but there are arcana people do not use them any more so how could you know what they mean you don't you have to look them up and figure out what they mean and that was very good for me to take a bunch of shakespeare and have to look at these look at this writing and figure out what it all means because i realized that when three years later four years later when i got a rules of engagement that was written by a lawyer and there was word to her i did understand i didn't stoallen this thorda no i said okay there's one of erstannet up figure out what it means make incipit and that's what no that's what studying shakespeare specifically did for me and you know as someone to get in some jasper right here and there's some very very powerful thing is that shakespeare will which are unmatched in language in my opinion so that found the road probably not too far but that is why i studied english in college how do you deal with delay unset muscle soreness or stiffness from wittinen and how did it affect your tuita the yutestid also so obviously i work out i work out forty much every day i i work out that means i left wagtails i do sprint i do some kind of physical conditioning every single day and that means that yes i am always at least somewhat sore and tired when i shall to train the guitar which i usually do any evenings so for me digito always makes me feel better you know your your basically getting a very gnarly for body message would you change your there get in a very aggressive and involuntary in foodless as and you're getting stretched in different directions so whenever you know if i did some exercise that made me so if i do dead less and i'm feeling sore tito my back and i go do you get you by the time at ten i don't feel that sonatas just like a musaeo stretch i think it it um loosened and its pretty normal for me i also like to train sore and tired because it's make training a little bit harder and make you more ready and all that being said when i do have a squat or high repetition squats or any squats where i can push the envelope ye my legs are really sore and it sucks to get on the mat and i heany and and also training while you're muscles are to orthen you're tired it helps your technique right on to say you're not on the state bigger guy no you don't having strengthened weight at the same time is an advantage can be used as a weapon but can get in the way you technique iteration and all give him that way of your progress and progress half for sure am you might be speaking from a stand point of someone who in good condition by the way cause i would say that for most people i would argue for most people it's not a full bottom of ashies it losing makes you more sore yes and you know what does a good point and that beyond the fact this is you actually are right on more points in you know because beyond the fact that yes i am in fairly good condition because i do work out every day also gigito me because i am experienced is generally not a one hundred per cent physical war like you have when you're not quite as experienced rest and if you watch you you know what i'm rolling with guys all my training partners they're all die guys too so where were training for you know an hour and we can do it it's not because we're in that much better condition it's just that work that that much more relaxed were line more in technique so so that's a good point and i could see were in the early isnot haveing said i trained this way the whole time that i'm trained in even when i was a sparanise belt warrior i still worked out every day in and when i was a blue bell training super had i still worked out of a day so your i was going down the path that you were right but now redolent that says that you're wrong and you just need to work out get on the mat loosened up and keep training i think in the grand scheme the things you'd be more lutherus we're talking about delayed on set muscles soreness i think i think i would argue that most people after training judith unless it is like the alight like roll but if you're you know if you're doing just utantur judges again the day does for round six minutes one minute in between he's going to get more delayed on sedemus sorenesses day from the jitsuing so bra i a i don't think so at this is a issue that will not be solved on the jocolpus i would say try it try it that's one then i beg lousie been trying it for gesanges she wanter things every time you show up to do you jesuits not a competition day you know and and not that you don't have rolls and good rolls and you go hard but there is a difference between like almae this guy past my guard or on weenah i'm an an on with every little piece of my otoliths look you're giving me rigore with you but it's still doesn't change my argument that even if you're only know it yet i i think that ye after rope pretty light to not get any delayed once muscle okay of years more morsels and the isere this were you might be right vision a story so like i just talk about when i went to college so i went to college at the university of san diego it was i was still in the military but i was my job was to go to college which meant that for somebody that was used to working eighteen hours a day as a seal alofa sudden i don't have a our state to work so i trained other that and one of the things i noticed one day a for whatever reason i had i think i had one of my kids was born and i had final exams or just some some perfect storm of events and i missed it i didn't train juger three days and on the fourth day i got up out of bed and i felt all like young and i wasn't sore a disguise can i feel great what is this and what it was was that i had traded and at that time at that time we this is when dan lister and i were training like mad men and he was constantly can beating i was competing any and he was and we would train for two or four hours a day of just psychling and but again even were doing cycle rolling like that it wasn't competition day and but we but it definitely made me so he into yet you do get some soreness and esther correct and i think i'm just a used to being in a continued stay here so novitate when you're like a yeah i ever overtree days on that for intellect that fourth day you woke up your like daniel young what is this but that's called restorest it and you recommendation alternate days obviously days might octant i don't know okay so this question is am i i donno's an addition to the other question but it's freeslik this also i'd like to hear more but more but your writing process tough times what worked well creative break through said trot i don't think these related i think there is just pulled out so all right right just creative fratres yes so first of all i if i teosofia ly on how i rode this book and you could probably apply this tune any kind of task or you're looking at doing but the first thing we did and lay from iarovitch the first thing we did was we outlined the book and what the chapters were about and what the stories inside the chapters so we both knew what the chapter was and then we set an end if you have a rather book i wrote half the chapters and he wrote half the chapter so we didn't we didn't write it to get their retrying mind medhope thing now the intro we wrote gathering the outdoor whatever it's called we run together and that was cowed we just added it because he was both of us talking but we didn't have to try and mind melder come to agreement on the rest of it we just wrote separate chapters and so what i did was once we once we knew what the chapters were once we knew it there going to be about then i wrote a thousand words a day no matter what that was my i was very busy at the time was doing some big contract i was super busy and i knew that i had to do it in chunks and i also know that my attention span is the i can force it but it's not fun so a thousand words took me about an hour like fifty minutes to an hour so every day no matter what i sat down and i i ended up writing about sixty thousand words so took me noting his fifty five thousand more to me fifty five days fifty five days straight in my draught was done and that's that there's a couple of good advantages to it number one when you write every day if you write if you skip two days and iglak guess what you've got to go back and re read what you wrote because you don't remember it when as if you just go back into it the i could just pick up where i left off boom i could start writing again and howlate im on oftest in the time of an go back and re read i know what my train of thought was hard thing mine so that was important and sometimes i didn't feel like reading of course but i jotan in imaged come out not that great but it doesn't matter you got a thousand words you can hold and you can adjust you can turn them something good in and also it just takes away every excuse one there's no excuse to heureuses only you do it you're supposed to do that's the only thing not i'm don know what a fan god i'm i'm i lost my train a fat i have writer's face whatever i'm too tired now like an answer for all these problems and that is right so got right a back good right you've got i'm too tired to had a long day good right oh antolin don't know where to take this story good right that's the only its one answer solved every problem and that's kind the same thing with with everything you know with going to the gym you know i'm tired good goork out i'm sort good go on out i'm supervise right now good go work out an you could do this you go flytin sort of you know with training you get you i don't know if i'm i'm i'm not feeling like my aching tonight good go train when you're weak run gold go train with your meddling up not there because it doesn't matter what is it is it the world championships to day and even if it is the waldachini because the old chap i jested not a maitrayana you get you can look at these when you say that that applies to everything like you don't feel like it or whatever lettin create like creative block and i'm just realizing right when you said that is the visiters time i'm kind of understanding this and realizing that tokay when you have a creative block that's almost like in my extraneis a good reason to not do creative stuff because i can't con creativity comes from a real like you have to feel a gestated it it's like a creative thing right in esperando yorihime factor in proudly we tenacious d oh tayeto can't you know mentative astronomum so you know it's different then bowing to sigimerus ying go if you get creative work and tis you too echo does the right and produces and films into racks videos of all kinds so your saying when you can't think what to write you just stop yes he has a queer in erateina an alien tangents and that's that's okay i mean we all different technics i mind my technique is not better than your technique your technique may work sometimes but it may be work a hundred per cent for you i'm talking about my technique in my technique was like okay i've got righters blackenin the watogo this unterhalten what year saying is when that happens to you you say you know what i'm sonno from it right now and come back to a later and after canistoto rihow though i just realized it when he said okay if you don't feel like writing or good it do it anyway because i guess i never really thought pass that be cut when you say yet you'll just have more stuff to hon into okay if if laernean you do hit inspiration which now you have more material to draw aminition from it's going to come clear like okay that thing that i wrote or you know put in when i wasn't inspired the okana's gotta go but you can learn so much from what you put down their white isn't that work or a dago pretty good when i was feeling bored when i viewing whatever that's pretty good how many is that you know so you're going to you gotta get way more results potentially than you would if you simply don't do anything in a strati it tis for consecon back whitsands it ran ofttime on to ate so yeah um good lesson learn it there thanks not is a good one so next question from jennifer from jennifer uwantit ahoy there that asanam nice jenifer oh genesis i am really struggling with focus lately i love for you to cover it on the poast focus cover that is i do it as a alifanfaron asked specific agilely but folkestone this is one of those things in this is this is i am starting to realize a underlying them with a lot of with lotte r asking me and that is i think people have a vision or a thought that i i've got some answer that is i oh in flaccus follow step one to inthral about this leadership and i've got some easy button solution for the situations and this got me thinking about my kids and one of my daughters who when she was a donowat you are when you're supposed to learn the time tables but she was that age and she got really disappointed because she didn't know her time tables and she would actually let your young without i have get out don't i forget the grade but it's you know it's like maybe second gray i can start great escon third grade so she supposed to know the times and at tables she doesn't know and she starts getting this this negative attitude of i'm stupid in you know i'm dumb other kids know on i don't know em and i just said oh well ave you studied him and she hadn't she hadn't studied him she'd sat in class when they would go over them and she picked up fifty or sixty arabicised e per cent of him but you know there's some heart ones in there right twelve times to twelve times twelve is a half one something of the same tricky one now that she did know and so i said oh well you need to study him and then you'll know them so you know we may be flash cards and she studied onananiche realized that you have to practise these things gave to put effort into them and to same thing with sport you know you'll get the kid that is amnatapoi may fall wife don't spend any time practising it re and so it's the same thing with focus you i picks effort you just don't i don't wake up in the morning flipwing the become focus when i was writing while just talking about writing this this book that we wrote i didn't go okay flipped the switch for focus i'm goin to do with elsworthy not one i do it i just sit down and go caliste eight yet he gussob you need to do it get it done me you know another another funny story is in the yelpings have these helmets for we we had an we modified him sense but where these helmets and underneath the helmets you would wear this this head set that your radio head fullans would go into some when you're in the selhams you're out on the battle field you got a talk to different people and you've got to have a radiant you've got nice almost i guess it will it be to describe in sacabo noise canceling head set for all practieses but it sturaban you wear that underneath your helmet and if you are to leadership position sometimes you have one brooded talking into one ear and the other one might be the air frequency aircraft aristogeit all the stuff gown inside your head and that's tricky and kind of a pain but what was really painful was the way they made these headsets they didn't fit right so they were very painful and they they actually squeezed your head so you put your put your head set on and then you put your helmet on over it any actually squeezed your head and it was very very uncomfortable do you headache it was just it just wasn't fun at all it sucked so we were out on this training mission and this is when i was attacking to command her and it was a long one he was yoort hours we were out there on this target and we were securing it and we were holding it and we are searching at new notes took a long time in about eight hours into it one of the junior officers came up to me and he says have you kept her helmet on this whole time and i said yes he said doesn't it hiawatha yes and that was it you know there was just pain to be experienced and i deducted up and eventually we figured i had a hot to cure it but the point is is that does it take some pain to focus the yes it is not easy there's it takes will but it takes mental effort to make it happen you know it's there we get into kind of the things i think i talked about pastry you know shut off the music set a goal from what you're trying to get down and importation it on it you that i used to raise myself on its right in those words you know i race and see how fast i can get em done and then go and that's that's that that's your focus your folk is is something that you can tow you can make happen so get focused practice folking practice focus yet cause the kanefer glance or the first sight is it that you practiseing you be focus on practising or you focus on writing or you focus on you know and if you can't focus if you practise focusing then you can foliating and atesorase body knows the the dead lines make you more focused and when lonetome so put it that line on yourself and make it real somehow or right like kindlike if some one tetotailer and ten minutes in clean your house pretty quick and that ten minutes had yorinobu put yourself for three hours to pain it's goin to take your hour it brotaer i as lay on icarian people would do plan for operation how long does it take to plan for an operation we always say a half an hour longer than you have that i saw long just take her together planning in and go forward as to diet what do you eat and any thoughts on using superfloo moran to crease full nutrition amatoriis no added note it was etanoitceffa onstrate things up i wouldn't interrupt some kind of a grain and kind of a drain so what do i a insert i i guess you'd classify me as a pale type person i am stake a chicken i eat pork i actually for a reason i don't like the taste of fish and sea food that much or eggs which is really unfortunate yeah i know it's really desire i eat a lot of hamburger growing up and i kind of didelot of sea food grown up so i distant a meet not a big fan so i but i eat a lot of state chicken for it a some kind of salad you know just about every day as seizure love caesar saltation that a spanish sallow i put a lot of all volante can a bet at this is peter the it whose billy smart doctor and see i guess the president seosamh called nesenus which is this nutriment resents large with a beeston ization to study nutrition and he he gave me a good fought or the way he explained the salad you know he he looked at salads as a vehicle to a fat m by just putting a tonof be now alive will basically so i i've gotten into that lately and disabilities big saws with mass of amount of all well secatary of fat it so i'm definitely a a fan of eating as much fatassi ble you know if you want to if you want to talk about why i do that if you did was a book called gold colors bad cowries by guaricos which is a a fantastic book and gives a lot of background on it the like i said peter tea whose just a billy guy who that i've had a lot of great long conversations with because we've done some stuff together and he's actually a person that in introducing to him paris i i i meant that a first pocasset's funny will go out for dinner and he wants no about seal stuff but i want about nutrient underdressed so that we have good conversation and good trade off but he will you know he explained attest really well and then and then another good thing thorson the tempers pocasse didn't nervouth dam daggering of really good perspective another another doctor that you know a work out gian and understand teritory well so that's where i am have gotten to in my life and i've got a long story you know about nutrition and maybe some day we can go into it it's just just the discovery and it just with every one else and it just the fact that i guess to ony something twenty five years ago every one thought when not every one but most people fought sat was bad and carboro that's not true actually cares are bad and fat is good so it's been a it's been a re and i was lucky to have been around people that knew that early in and taught the information to me so that's that's the in a nut shell and if you want to get with the expert then people like guarantors people like peter to a people like dom daggers they're the ones that can give you the science behind what i'm talking about or or what i esperances well nutrition it nutrition is also one of those subjects that you know people vehemence with each other on there was a while where i was manned by my wife from talking about nutrition with her france in the early days of me being completely pro fat and pro protein and really anti carbohydrates when young one really fought that you know ten years ago in i would be giving all of her friends a hard time about what they reading and what they refeeding their kids and a my wife of entally band me because i was problematic and they askeaton here eeen just saying you know carbar bad i mean there's a lot to that needle but to say careered that's the controversial thinken and this other thing and i i i keep saying this but i'm not all might hear to convince anybody any faye want o tell me that cards are great good for you all i'll be enjoy tied you but i bet he's got after it but let us not like carbet cecily you don't it now begin to start a little argument or in up no i m not going to so hauteur the bottom line is i i don't this is stuff that i have savored out i've learned from people i've used it myself and i know what works for me and an if you don't want to believe that i'm okay with that some year to save your life i'm not here to you jane your mind you know and this same thing you know you here says about jugee i used to be really you don't know judices better than this and digesteth now with no actually there's other and first walters other perspectives but also that our correct and get and all believe that you did though i sleeve new be well round it and all the under stuff but the bottom ees on not a i'm not a year to convert people but somebody asked what i ate and that told him right is at that's what i incalation hundred percent true that's what i did it you want to argue those points don't argue with me arguit peter the argument very tobes are you at dom daggerous those guys are i mean peter and damascenes and doctors so they know and they will give you the facts which i could give you what i want to do nearly as goneness asiago next question a couple of days i like to hear you a thought than richard mark cino marco mar since in henry rollin maringouins so littoral with dick marco demotic martino who if you don't know who that is he was a seal in vietnam seater vietnam he was the founder of saltese he created sulphitic he ended up getting in trouble with the navy and they kind of did a witch hunt on him and he was eventually the outhaul he did he did a little bit o jalline they found that he had falsified some travel records and may be to money but they found stuff on him but it was kind of trivial stuff that was trumped up um but be in a porc amount of military and he wrote a book in the ninety early night his pitched up in haseltines right around the wine i got actually through buds in a tisipheme sometime around nineteen ninety and renten ty one he wrote a book called to roger and did amazing well sold a lot of copies and was definitely broke the mold of this idea of the quiet professional which was how i was smoker ainly raised in this feltrams and something that i've i've obviously contradicted now because rode a book with life have this pocasse been on t v of definitely broke the paradise of the quaratesi nal i absolutely try to respect the spirit of the quirites sional and i i'm not you know even if i the book that lay for i row isn't a book about our triumphs and everything we did great it simpleton what we learned at usually from bad situations in humbling experience that's what the book is about and it's an effort to pass on leadership lesses learned that we learned in a humbling way so so there's that but richard martino from my perspectively again missus right when i came in he was kind of the guide that broke this mould on and of course has been you know dozens and dozens of quauco sealed books now but he with the first one very well received and definitely got some flax from the seal community and that is what it is now now i worked for gisha worked for him that literally or you know they that he was their commanding officer and i remember one of them i said to this one sin our guide that was had been ton of experience and i said you know you work for martino won how was he and he looked at in the no hesitation said best commanding off driver had an that's i heard that everybody ever asked just about told me that the only people that you care ything different from would be senor senor officers that he was you know he be over the top he wasn't he quite played a game and but there's no doubt about it you atalide who was a hard core guy and the de guise that walk for him respected him and liked him the thing that i learned from him was seeing how that transition took place and how he he the thing that god him to where he was to to get the responsibility of creating selenic which is this elite counterterrorist part of the navy it obviously he was trusted he was liked and he was respected in so i saw that he had got himself to that level which is very cool but i also saw and i again this is a comic he comes up a lot or strength are often our biggest wheat weaknesses and so this kind of cowboy mentality that aggressive mentality that he had it got him there but once he got there it doesn't seem like he was able to rein that back in and that is something that i became cognizant because no doubt when i was a younger guy when i was a young seal and then a young sheaffer i was definitely fairly galbois and as i moved up the ranks i recognized that i had to mature and i had to grow up and i had to do things different i couldn't die same things they did when i was a young putting as i could i decide it up when i became a young officer and the ever became a button commander and it became a task in a commander and i i had to grow up you know for lack of a better word and and looking back i should on up even more you know but i don't see that at the time so that something that i learned from marco beaten on never worked for him and i met him a handful times you know but never spentacle time with them but i have also seen this exact same thing with business later with seas especially with seas that come into a company that is not doing well and there's only one kind of person that can turn that comperou somebody with a dynamic personalities and with the vision some one has got to kick down doors and this on make things happen and you see those guys who in there they did that done and they turn those companies around and then the real test comes is can the transition from being that cowboy to be in that company person to be in that straight shooter straighten narrow that takes it takes the company then from stutevill to drive and some of a make it and some of them don't and i look at dick mercanti nary tale to everybody that comes up through the ranks and gets to that point where you need to take it to the next level and how you have to change what got you there is not going to be what keeps you there you have a change in you have to adopt and grow and so i think that's important to recognize in its importance to constantly be looking around for examples and saying oasis what happened there and try and push herself forward so that's that's my by i don't want to say my opinion is not really my opinion that's those are my fought on demonic marsano the roarer the other one is any wrongs and if you don't know who had rerelative was a young kid from the d c area who grew up in de pancrace in d c went to a military academy and eventually even though he was kind of just a kid at at some point a band called black flag who was a incredible band led by a ugatori they asked rawlins who was just a fan who had jumped on the stage of some point saying one or songs they said ay they the they had a falling out of you what happen with their first a singer but the first thing it wasn't seen any more they needed new singer they asked rollestin rounds jump on me opportunity and took that gig and ended up being the lead singer of the band black flag who is a really pivotal band in american rock enall in i think he took you know black flag to a whole new level and of talked about doctor up as on timariot about her again but there was an album called black flag my war which is the uncredible an album and it's especially an incredible out albuminates end of jelson and doubt there dreco used to come on a piece of fine and there was two sides to it in and so the the black flag outcalled my war had two sides to it the first side sounded fairly similar to what most of black flag sounded like priorata which is to sort of punok fast be whatever sighed too was this slow down heavy dredging powerful music and a whole side is like that and that that side of that album was on my record player when i was a thirteen or fourteen years old four lanaherne's all i listened to and i really related to it because it it just was something that this heavy this introspective this this a grecian and anger was something that i ordered but i heard it for the first time i sakatani think that's that's what my mind is filled with and this was a sort of my the next thing i came after blackapit for me he is by savatist thing had okada's what i that's a have and that's dark and i understand i relate to that the happy music that i was here and in derstand the ididn't relate to it the heavy stuff when i heard that this dark stuff i related to it no understood in an efim and so rawlins black face my war sighed to definitely had a big impact on me and then from there eventually he was out a black flag and he formed his own band and and they made an epic record which is called lifetime just up again the this hit me at an age where oh what was i sixteen and here comes this album called lifetime that was a very powerful very raw very hard and it just i can't imagine a better sound coming into my ears when i was fifteen or sixteen years old then this alife time so myself and my buddies at the time we were listening to rowland's and again this wishes were songs about powers were songs about an matterofact the caller of the lifetime alboise hands gripping the earth in it was new this contessa of at least that's how i interpreted esteemer i was a kid and i'm hearing the stuff and i'm overlaying what my fox of the world are on top of it it sounded aggressive to me it sounded tossed to me and that's what my mind was like it that i and so i put what i wanted it to i made it when i wanted to be unto me two hands wolling the earth for was a powerful symbol of a minute dominate over walmington roll of the world of an make things happen so we actually when i was a kid we actually followed round around and we will we would you know he played this was in losing so the ayah or eighty nine but myself in my bodies who we are and around and we went by piola ten or fifteen times on the eastern seaboard maybe letting tom maybemaybe ten times and we beatissima in the day this is this is it you know he's planning calls that wins your letting room you know you're in weed help him all loathe instruments and we help maffled we hang out with him afterwards and it was it was great it was cool and that was my experience and i was definitely i think that had a big impact on me another thing had a mentions about light that albeit in between the songs you know if you look at vinal records and there is a space in between the songs and in the teresa standard on an a waterest ndard of two millimeters let's say and when i first got that life time record this space in the kenions you could see it was it was tiny and that's because the the the one son would end in bone that the other song after a moment of unboomed taken an that's what the album was like this intense is driving getting after it so we would go to a show and we were just going completely nuts in and get our insane maskit destruction on so out of that you know pondfish other things go you know lansas you know we were not in drinking we were not a drugs in either was an so he was this kind of ininees wons doing push ups before the shows we tak all yauthitha guys like as ye know this i related to this gae'in be strong and i don't want to do drugs and i'm staying clean and he stayin clean and so we had this good thing going hum but again this is my fifteen year old brain run and ah so what happens so i took all that to mean that's the way life is for instance rollins as a big catch you on his back that's a search and destroy okay you you i i took that literal heavened to search him destroy how do you do that okay what is the most hard core thing what is the most physical thing what is how do you do control how do you do how you be aggressive in the end degree undo it you be a command now and so so those again those weird twisted interpretation of my mind oosed to me okay that means you need not be a commando and that's what i did that's how i intatte one of the i would say one of those factors that led me on the path adam that a mere today so when through seal training and actually interestingly the first love posture and we'd haf to opliche when i was been with the first ball a pose and rolled his playing and they played down in somewhere entendido malleposte came and i went in and i didn't want to pay for it for whatever reason so i went back stage and i waited until i saw long once as all ones and i said a roan he said ay and in evitare agnized me an we hev he recognized me when over said i and i said he can you give me to the show and i got a couple of bodies with me and he said it beset get you in to fort knox it was kind of weird because back in the day we would sit there and hang out with him and help him load his van and get walk right in and it was just really cool to have that much interaction with somebody that you were into i mean you can't do that normally and all of a sudden there i was now he's a lonelier and even though he's on tour and he has known body there there's a guy there me and i can't get in so it was you know that's cool um but as it was definitely a a sign to me that that things were a little different houman he kind of made it right isadena and headed up having some pretty big or be he as some bigger records that did better than than life time but the way it kind of continues did the way this story continues is that wrongin was a guy when i was a kid that talked about vietnam that and if you read any of his nearabout books and i read his books and you talk about vitam that's all this guy caught him so much about discipline in it and then he talked the state this search in destroy and in his book serenissio he re talk about the violence and the fights and all these things and an even talked about like mission remained calm prepared to destroy that tomasino i had ingunson remained calm prepared to troy so he he kind of had this thing that i fought was cool when i was fourteen and then i actually went in and i did this stuff you know i actually went and did the stuff that he had talked about and that he spent his career talking about in so all the suddenness connection the sort of um the the connection that i had with him all was sudden it kind of faded because i i i looked at it from a different light as it was no longer me looking at some one thinking this guy done this cool stuff it was actually starting to look at him thinking he didn't do this colstaff and and now i think when i see him now in its where i think he's not ten years older than me maybe twelve years older than me so he i can kind o see it's a little bit of a glimpse of a future benoue you see a guy that's certain years older that you and he knowed looked like you when he was twenty five and you know needled like when he was thirty five and forty five and now he's probably fifty five and i can see what he looks like and what he did look like so i kind of i i see him now and he seems to be ill result of that life that he ended up with which is hollywood and kind of famous and kind o being in movies and being a rock star it and it's i don't have the same like i said connection that i that i did but like i said when i was a kid now was thirteen years old when i was fourteen year old one i was fifteen years old i was i was definitely i i definitely took some things from him and applied him to my life and i thought i loved to be up with a knowles and it fits some point hank if you listen let me now let's saw let's lie up will talk about the old times eniwetok i think it might milbe something close with his wind when you're dealing with people people are not o you want them to be your idol the people that look you look up through the people that you think are cool but not they're not that person it ciliaris it now there's things that we can learn from people but they are gonna be what you think they are they are going to be even what they should be as those people when you take him an you put him on a pedestal there not deserving it that peticote going to be faulted they're going to be weak they're going to be eglantine we condescend they made all those negatives me lazy they're goin to entitle a be short sighted the not going to be perfect far from and that's fine but okay you learn from their weaknesses and you learn from their strength of course and you mimic them and you you emulate them but equally is important you learn from the faults and you see what not to do because a bottomlands you can't control other people and i we spent time to night talking about manipulation and influence but the bottom lines you can't control you can't make a people be what you want them to be the only person that you can control is you yantta you got focusing focus you take is a focus for his own making yourself go you want to be faster smart stronger more humble lessee this saplin your boy see can free our mind get up early and go get after it and be that person that you want to be and that's not easy and not every one can do it and i'm not here to tell everybody that everybody can do it but it can happen and it does happen to one small decision at a time and every one of those decisions important in building he and at all got foretaste very everyone out there thanks arlesin preciate it thanks surceasing that's kind of how we know that people are listening thanks were reviewing we get the chance let us know what you think and let the world know what you think spread the word we want to keep doing these potass so thanks and most of all cerinthe thank you forgetting after it this is jocko until next time out
