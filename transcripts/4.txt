this is jacopo gasped number four with teachers and me jock a willing come so several years ago i was at the u and i beeootiful can watch you ave ses an i been to a attentive know how many but it's it's many many times i was there with fighters that i trained cornering them or with fighters that i trained with and i was watching them some into a lot of you see and this one in particular i don't remember i don't even remember which fight it was and who was fighting or who i was coaching or whatever but my work for the night and was done and so now it was time to do kind of sit back to lac and watch the rest of the fight and i actually linked up with one of my good seal friends who i was in remanebit and we were sitting there having a good time in his post remodeling this round two thousand seven two thousand eight two we've been home for a year or two and or sit there watching enjoying and all of a sudden a y in the arena that we were in there's big giant streams and the u s c plays various advertisements in between fights and normally there's some noise in their background and their people are kind of continueth what they're doing for whatever reason this advertisement came on and it captured every one's attention not to smite so were sitting there all the sudden kind of everyone was surcantine by this advertisement that came up on the screen and it was a commercial for a video game and on not of video game player and i just don't know much about video games but the video game was called gears of war and the commercial was right here and if you're watching is on you two bornation you to the link because we don't want to it her fear with the right of the commercial so well put that in the link on you to but it's a garsia you if you type in you to be years of war rondevoo death run eve with death you will see this commercial i have a run broodeth a some disputed by a cad it may be he shall take my hand and lead me into his dockland and closed my eyes and quite my breath i have a under who in daranato my pleasure worn heroines i hear that commercial i see that commercial and i'm honestly as i see this i'm kind of surprised or shocked and maybe even a little bitten barecas something about that commercial hit me in a way that i didn't think that some hollywood video game commercial producer should be able to do i felt like that should be able to happen and i don't feel like that very often and so when fights were over and i got back to my hotel room and when i got there i just i was still thinking about this i still thinking about this commercial that i saw and so i open a computer and i googled rondavel with death and sure enough there it was not the video game commercial but a home a real poem that was written by a real poet who was a real warder and i did some research on him a turn out this guy that wrote this poem was in alan seeger he was born in the eighteen eighty eight rays in staten island new york had a privilege pretty privileged upbringing went to private schools and an up going to college at harvard he was class mate with pitsligo us can surrounded by very important and influential people and when he graduated from harvard he went to paris on and from what i can tell he wanted to kind o continue this this life style of an artist or of a poet and while he was in paris world war one broke out and on august twenty fourth nineteen fourteen allen segar joined the french for region he wrote in a letter to his mom about this move i hope you see the thing i do and think that i have done well being without responsibilities and with no one to suffer materially from my decision in taking upon my shoulders to the burden that so much of humanity is suffering under and rather than stand ingloriously aside when the opportunity was given me doing my share for the side that i think right so this young gy goes off and he actually wrote a bunch of letters home and you kept a journal as well which is very interesting in perhaps it will become what of our future topics on this pot cast but the poem which is called rendezvous actually is a little bit longer than what they put in the commercial and were read the full poem the gain written by alan seeger and here is ranihat a rendezvous with death at some disputed barricade when spring comes back with rustling shade and apple blossoms fill here i have a roundabout death when spring brings back blue days and fair it may be he shall take my hand and lead me into his dark land and close my eyes and quench my breath it may be i shall pass him still i have a roundabout death on some scarred slope of battered hill when spring comes round again this year and the first meadow flowers appear god knows toward better to be deep pillowed in silk and scented down where love throbs out in blissful sleep pulse nigh to pulse and breath to breath where hushed awakenings are dear but i verandah had death at midnight in some flaming town when spring trips north again this year and i to my pledged word am true i shall not fail that rendezvous and he did not fail that rendezvous in seer was killed in action july fifth nineteen sixteen as he in his units success we charged the heavily fortified french village in france called beloy and sumter was during attacks one of the small fights in what became known as the battle was so which resulted in four hundred and twenty thousand british casualties two hundred thousand french casualties and five hundred thousand german castles from one battle talking a little bit about how he died this is from a friend of segar that was with him during the attack about four o'clock the order came to get ready for the attack none could help thinking of what the next few hours we bring one minute anguish and then once in the ranks faces became calm and serene a kind of gravity falling upon them while on each could be read that the termination and expectation of victory two battalions were to attack are companied being the reserve of of the talian the companies forming the first wave were deployed on the plain they in etcetera in the air above the corn already quite tall the first section which was allan section formed the right and vanguard of the company and mind formed the left wing after the first bound forward we lay for flat on the ground and i saw the first section advancing beyond us and making toward the extreme right of the village i caught sight of segar and called to him making a sign with my hand he answered with a smile how pale he was his tall so a wet stood out on the dream of the corn field he was a talisman in his section his head he wrecked and pride in his eyes i saw her running forward with bayonets fixed soon he disappeared and that was the last time i saw my friend meteor from john kikin's face of war so seegar we shot mis stomach and wall he bled to death he reportedly continued to encourage his fellow soldiers to press on he was passvoord ed be french cross of war and the military medal and like many many soldiers especially one from world war one he was buried in a mask rave now the reason i started off to day talking about alan seeger am i because i wanted talk about world war one and and i often tell my son that were war and is the the one war that i would not want to participate in it was just completely savage and brutal and if you haven't listened to blue print for armageddon on hardcore history which is an absolutely phenomenal phenomenal pages but the haveless that listen to it it will give you a good oversight of the war but what really disturbs me about where war on and what scares me about world war one is that you a very very limited control over your destiny you could not use your brain and your tactical prowess and your skills to keep you alive you you know if you watch any footage of world war one it was listen there's the were no trench there in their trench at this designated time we are going to get up that we are on to go over the top and we are going to charge and it was just absolutely brutal brutal warfare now that is kind of what brings us to a book that i wanted to talk a little bit about to day and but this book is a very quick read the very interesting read i looked for it on amazon its aninial able in some digital version it's also available for free if you just bugle this book for free can find it it is called battle leadership and it's by a guy named captain aid of vance who was in the german army and to give you a little information on captain vance in a way he has this sort of phenomenal insight into war um me tell you a little bit about it missus from the forward of the book he entered the imperial german army a few years prior to the outbreak of world war of the world war so this is reddinin the thirties when there was no second world war the mobilization in nineteen fourteen found him on the belgian frontier in command of an infantry patoon in october nineteen fourteen to pardon several battles which occurred during the storica to the sea and gave you watch hardcomes no ardour history you will you will hear all about that in one of the east he received the first of several wounds the world war was to bring him and he was sent home in february nineteen fifteen he returned to duty and he was a company commander there under hindenburg's company marched and fought in metre deep snow and series engagements known a storps the winter battles of the mercer of the masurian lakes in which over one hundred thousand prisoners were taken from july to october the same uratipa on a gigantic austro german of soul of the polish salient which was climaxed by the fall of warsaw following this the german drive to the east was carried carried the young officer in the russia as far as the bersina river this summer filled with endless marches and repeated engage in engagements gave him a wide experience in the open warfare tactics of small units in nineteen sixteen in nineteen sixteen captain valence still the east operating close conjuction with the austrians in endeavorest p the bruce olov steam roller the nineteen seventy his division was transferred to the remenent were anchel took parlouer of engagements in the higher altitude of the carpathians the nineteen eighteen the war carry the author into its by paths the train the crimea and the cocasse orestes found him operating against the bolshevik after war was over he stayed in the army he was in all kinds of different um positions as he stayed and he ended up actually in between after world war one he came to america and went to for bending georgia and went through air borne school which an american army school and this is where this volume miss this information develop from because while he was going through a boche thought a bunch of classes and reason he was selected to teach all these classes as some rise pretty well again in the ford from the book there is probably no officer in our army who is participated in so many wide revering types of military operations as captain vance his knowledge of war was gained first hand a meeting engagements advanced guard battles were garcin night attacks rillwater mountain fighting in which he took part he has run the entire gamut of tactical experience from pursuit to withdraw from an assault on permanent fortifications to a major offensive in the rigors of a russian winter there is no page of his story as set forth in these lectures that is not worthy of study by american officers and i will say this yes he is extremely experienced obviously i mean just any credible amount of battle experiences specially in world war one with the casualty rate was so absolutely crazy but also and perhaps mountorry and you'll see this as soon as we get into his writings if he had an incredible mind for an incredible mind for leadership and i think that is what makes it makes him some present will makes his writing so important and right out of the gate the first chapter by the sky who again is the disguise don't be all this war fairies you know don raids in a solon defenses he done all these things all these tactical things and the first chapter is called battle field psychology so he's not talking about his not talking about the tactics and how to fight and how to maneuver he's talking about battle field sit cology what did he mean by that from the book here psychology as i understand it means knowledge of the soul yet how shall we speak about the soul of others when we do not even know our own is there a single one of us who can say with certainty how he will react to some given event nevertheless as leaders we must have some knowledge of the souls of our soldiers because the soldier the living man is the instrument with which we have to work with in war so this is something um in going back to when i got interviewed by tempers and he asked me what was the most complex operation you revocare of in my answer was look the operations himself on that complex the complex thing about being a combat leader is dealing with human beings here and that was clearly what vance thought as well back to the book the great commanders of all times had a real knowledge of the souls of their soldiers let us use a more simple phrase in all the knowledge of the soul knowledge of men knowledge of men in all wars has proved an important factor to the leader it is probable that this will be still more true in future wars and i am here to attest hundred years later that knowledge of the soul of your solidis still the most important thing to understand as a leader this is interesting now he's goin to get into why this increased in importance during the world war one prior to the world war all armies fought in comparatively close order so this is when you go back to watching the red coats fight and they're all lined up or you watch brave hart never on's line up or to any of those that he the failings you know back in the day how the how the spartans fought every one had this you know you were at close order you are close to your ear teammates your fellow soldiers the psychological reaction of the individual soldier was not so decisive since the fighting was done not by the individual but by mass and the mass was held together by drill and discipline she had these very close literally close together organizations and i would tell you that even in combat to day would you get your your group must be gathered let's say in the ground floor of a building and i have forty seals in there and you you've if you hear me talk about be centralized command i'll tell you he can can i control forty shells all about feel no absolutely not that being said he put every one in a small ground for of a building and i can yell out a everyone must he hear weinbren out three minutes get a good head count check remover can you that you could kind of control them when you're not close proximity for a for at least thirty seconds you can get some control so he goes on to talk about that but more importantly he says moreover the psychological impression of battle were simpler rifle and cannon rolled the battle field and the enemy could be seen in modern war the impressions are much more powerful usually we fight against an enemy we can not see the machine will the battle field we no longer fight in great masses but in small groups often as individuals therefore the psychological reaction of the individual has become increasingly important so gain if you've got all your people must together that you can verbally talk to them and they can see you and you can set that example and you can lead them through physical contact it's a little easier to overcome whatever psychological barriers they might have when they sarcenet out and all of a sudden they can't hear everything and they can't see you any more now the psychological element becomes a lot more important as commanders we must know the probable reaction of the individual and the means by which we can influence this reaction the knowledge of man is especially difficult for two reasons first because it cannot be learned from books and that is one that i know dripple crazy and in it drives me crazy and also he will go and kanefer that a little bit because he does talk about how military men should study history because you do learn what to expect but to say that knowledge of men is especially difficult for two reasons first it cannot be learned from box i think we've all seen that you know well you get somebody that's been through some kind of a leadership academy and they try and do this doctrinal ized book solution for something in an ante fail with second because the characteristics of the individual in peace are completely changed in war now i agree with him on this with a caveat because you'll he saying that the way men reacting war is completely different from the way the race in peace and i would venture to guess that if he was alive and i was have this discussion with him utere with what i'm about to say it is not that the reactions are completely changed it is just that their reactions are amplified and intensified and that is something that lay in i talk about all the time when people ask us about in civilian companies you know it's different because it's not combat and we say combat is like life it's just amplified and intensify so when you have some business leader that's nervous about making a decision because they might lose a bunch of capital or set the company up for you know bad corder or whatever and that that's real that's real emotion its real fear its real hesitation all you do in combat you put some money to combat looristan and they are to make a decision where it could cost some on their lives or cottonton cause mission failure it's the same a motions but it's jist ample fight and i think that i think that vance would agree with me if he heard that explanation i think occasionally you get at the top end of intensity you do it some other emotions you know you get people be free but then again i see people in the business world that freeze when things get too complex or two crazy people free they become paralyzed and they don't make a decision because they're too scared so actually i would stick to my guns on this and say that the reactions although different there the same reactions are just amplified he goes on man react differently in war than he doesn't peace therefore he must be handled differently for this reason we cannot learn in peace times less psychology of war again i will tell you that the training that we put together when it was intense enough we would get to see in a micro way we get to see him beginning of those reactions at the guises would deliver in war is my belief that no one can give a prescription for a correct application of the principle of psychology in war the only thing of which we are certain is this the psychology of the soldier is always important no commander lacking in this inner knowledge of his men can accomplish great things that i would agree with well you have to understand your people and i would go one step further and say you not have do not just understand your people that work for you you need to understand the psychology of the people that are above you in the change of command understand what's driving them understand what kind of decisions there making and wiser making those decisions as long as armies were small and the battle field narrow a leader could exert psychological influence on his army by personal example in modern wars however the high commanders are necessarily far in the rear and the majority of the soldiers never even see them consequently the task of influencing an understanding the soldier psychologically has a large measure past a subordinate commanders for this reason we shall deal only with the psychology of individuals and small units so the esometha that is held true to day and that element there is there is this element in the army is called a company commander which is above a pecone in this guise in charge of a hundred maybe a hundred and fifty guys and that sort of the the level that i think this is a dressing and the reason is because above the company commander nauvoo patalam in her and while he has some influence you know he's got five hundred or seven hundred guys under him they don't they don't interact with him but that company commander he interacts with that and so that's why he saying that it's it that's the focus here so now in peace we should do everything possible to prepare the minds of soldiers for the strain of battle we must repeat only worn that warn them that war brings with it surprised and tremendously deep impressions and he kisses not word impressions and when i looked up just a kind of clarified e you know the closest thing that i think he saw her others i give you ideas i give you feelings you know war gives you these deep feelings and it in its trying to prepare men psychologically for what they're goin to face because it's going to be deep we must prepare them for the fact that each minute of battle brings with it anew assault on the nerves as soldiers of the future we ourselves should strive to realize that we will be faced in war by many new and difficult impressions dangers that are thus foreseen are already half overcome so something you know you've already half overcome acause you know it you expect it it's the thing that you don't know it's a thinger that you don't see that is going to really affect you in a negative way i'm going back to the book and again this is this opening chapter to me it is a battle field psychology just applied to so many different situations you know yes it's about battle but they at bow will life it really is about life and when you talk about preparing teens or preparing kids for things in the world that are going to hit them and out hard it's going to be you know i talk about with it asked a lot about self defence you know and some will say what what i do with my daughter how can i get her to deal to defend herself and i always say you know give him a talk but in terms of judith one of the things that the helps of girl was and a gibet is you used to physical contact and if you're not you that physical contact when it happens to you for the first time that an that alone is enough to throw you off and make you nervous and make you scare to make you freak out and not be able to react properly but when you do you just you i mean you got somebody grinding on he and smash in you an holdin you down in my i mean it just gets you you so that in it becomes that it pemecon ature for for a ditty oh you gotta get a fight signorial and saint then with some young inwit boxing or kick boxing someone squares off with you if you've never squared off with some one before it's a freak in panic situation or if you get hit i order he trihilatae situation as so these things are away all you know introducing people to dangers that are thus foreseeing and already half overcome so by training with these things the orapreo when you get in the situation in that's one of things that makes training martial arts prepare you for these self defensio let us take going back the book let us take several actual examples from war and sea weenen from them in studying these examples that should be borne in mind that they do not constitute universal formula i love this caliver thing that i think he thinks um you i always say like you can't just apply the same formula everything you have to have an open my god for your mind and as what you say in right there bare in mind they do not constitute a universal formula they deal only any now he doesn't cific they deal only with german soldiers moreover they deal only with particular german soldiers in certain definite situations whether other soldiers of other races would react similarly in sursit in similar situations i do not know but i believe not for instance the mentality of the american soldier differs from that of the german and even in america the northern soldier differs from the southern a soldier from the city of new york has an entirely different viewpoint than soldiers lived as a farmer in the middle west now i will say this i served with everybody goes from the city and i think where this is a lot different now a days and i think in in nineteen ten if you were a farmer from the middle west your former from the middle west and you hadn't traveled you hadn't seen much otherest the world if you were some of from your city you didn't travel youens i think this is probably less true now where you have people that even though there are farmer from the midwest guess what they've been all over the country they lived in cities they moved to cities they were were a lot more mobile of a of a people now in some much more global and on popite internet yellow movies ye have all this medea so i think this is probably the last true now that people are more well rounded the new used to be therefore to more exactly ah he will therefore reactively and will require different method of handling now that is true it as nothing to wither background has do well as do the back on but his half doiteir front has to do with him who they are as human beings and during the battle of ten and berg hindenburg luden door fules or germans of officers um and their staff were standing on a hill and observing a portion of the battle field while so engaged the well known colonel hoffman who is that the time the j three came up to it young captain of the general staff and said to him in a quiet tone my friend you seem to have nothing to do pay attention in the village of x there is all land stern battalion call up its commander and say to him a russian cavalry brigade has made a deep penetration in the direction of village ax the land stern italians to counter attack and throw back the russians on hearing this the young general staff officer became quite excited and said oh conall that land from the talian consists only of old men over forty five years old they cannot defeat a russian cavalry cavalry brigade the colonel answered merely given that order quietly and if the pitanate refuses to obey ask him for his name you will see that he will do it instantly the uncaptained the order over the telephone and in a time commander terribly excited answered how can i attack a russian cavalry brigade with my old man that's impossible then the captain said i have been directed if such as if such beaecan to merely ask you for your name oh me came the quick reply i did not mean it that way certainly we will attack how have my unit forward at once and in five minutes we will be on the march your orders will be executed immediately and they were the fear of unpleasant consequences resulted in the disappearance of all the commanders fears but the order with the withereth another italian commander in different circumstances the effect would probably have been entirely different colonel hoffman had correctly estimated the probable reaction of this potion commander now this is the same idea for this is very clear a really class go example of this art of estimating a situation psychologically was shown in year nineteen seventy at nineteen seventeen by a brigade commander the general said each of our three regimental commanders must be handled differently colonel aid is not want an order and i as you listen in this think about the people you know the people that you were with and these three people exist everywhere colonel a does not want an order he wants to do everything himself and yoawa does well we all now that person colonel b execute every order but has no initiative we all know that person colonel see opposes everything he is told to do and wants to do the contrary we all know that person a few days later the troops can fronted a well entrenched enemy whose physician would have to be attacked the general issued the following individual orders to conatione that most do everything himself my dear colonel a i think we will attack your regiment will have to carry the burden of the attack i have however selected you for this reason the boundaries of your regiment are so in so attack an ex hour i don't have to tell you anything more to colonel s who opposes everything he said this we have met a very strong enemy i am afraid we will not be able to attack with the forces at ardessa oh general certainly we will attack just give him my regiment the time of the attack and you will see that we are successful replied coals go then we will try it said the general giving him the order for the attack which he had prepared some time previously to colonel b will that always must have detailed orders and doesn't have a ittie the attack order was merely sent with additional details all three regiments attack spendidly this is something that when at one of late nor work with companies we run into this all the time where you have to modulate and a just year your directives in your interactions now i'm not saying in this is this is the the dicotomy that makes a tricky you can't be a different person to different subordinance or senor leader should be can't be this different person you have to modulate slightly to make these different impressions on people and give them a different read of you where if they talk to each other that they would still know you the same person at your not being this to face or a free face or a five faced person you got to have the consistency but you do have to model your personality and you it in different ways and use your speech and your words carefully because they affect different people in different ways and i've always had that i mean even between lafe and his sister put in command or who am i to brows but he had a little different relationship with both those guns and that's just the way it was and it was but both relationships were great and both was guy's work incredibly a successful and aggressive in in accomplishing the mission even though i had a little bit different a little bit different relationship and a little bit different way of dealing with each of them and they both had their own way of dealing with me so was it was an interesting dynamic of how well that work the general going back to the book the general knew his subordinate he knew that each one was different and had to be handled differently in order to achieve results he had estimated the psychological situation correctly it is comparatively easy to make a correct estimate if one knows the man concerned but even then it is often difficult necessitie this is where just gets crazy as because the man doesn't always remain the same he is no machine he may rat one way to day another way to morrow and this is going back to i think our first toast where i said that people are crazy people are crazy and they knew crazy things and that's what i ve got constantly have the open loop with people you got to give them something an you got to get that feed back in a weed and we act what they're saying and how its changing soldiers can be brave one day and afraid the next soldiers are not machines but human beings who must be led in war each one of them react differently therefore each must be handled differently and i know that sounds friend people always think that in the military you're just got all these troopers and they're just machine can gotten you away for i have been quoted saying this many times because people ask us in said well you were in church seals and those guys i thatthe do whatever you say it's just now ainmein there a human they after own free will they make their own decisions they decide what their thoughts are going to be i don't decide what their faults are annabel you ask that actually lead them yea furthermore each one react differently at different times and must be handled each time according to his particular reaction so it again you've got by open looped and reading and reacting what people were how people are acting to sense this and to arrive at a correct psychological solution is part of the art of the ship if he gonsalvo sometimes you'll find the situation where lessay a boss he'll be he'll say hay in a what's wrong with you your work out put isn't you know as as as much as it is next guy you know this god was wrong with you this gayheart on like everything i say he does it perfectly what wrong with you panting so that isn't that an example how a failure in doing that recognizing what this garipons to verses what this other guy reuel a depends because some people if i say echo this guy's doin better to you some people are supercherie and nanook warmer than that per somebody get you know an lands on people will take that with a negative to and said you know what that kind of even see what i do i'm london less intense each always a reed it's always a psychological read on people sthat makes it challenge yes so if if if you were to think like are your saying if you were to think that the just is one formula if all your putting out his one formulas the boss right and you see too out of your team of fotonovelas two of these guys are responding great to their power ficino but these other three dies are are kind operating with varying levels of success it's an indicator that i you have you know a dynamic group of people on the u s and they repandirent ly to different things that it is one of those perfect examples and a perfect example that is it okay now with regard to other matters still in the same chapter battle psychology we who been in war now that the hardest thing we had to do was lie quietly under hostile fire and wait for an attack why in this is something that i completely understand and relate to is this feeling in assuming i i think i talk about it on the time fairish show was when there's a movie called the pacific and the first episode you're expected expecting the big giant you know war battle superannuation and may draw you out for onestory minutes of them put your flowing through the jungle in the whole time you're just waiting in waiting a treatise tion and when i watch that for the first time i remembered that tension firm remodeler if a fire fight had start yet and your walking through the streets and you just feel the tension casyoun waiting for those round to go off an explosion to happen and it's very ah unnerving it's it's the it's a worst time to it's a worst feeling a and a remember actual my first opponent to iraq we were haling out a a fob which is the forenoon base who had been getting more ere an so he set a cool go out there and try to elp im out answer we went out we set up sniper positions and we started getting more wary and unfortunately the position we were in being give us any line sight to the people that were launching more so they were just freely launching mortars at as any were so close they were you know within probably two hundred meters that we could see we could hear the launches the mortars and we could see the the the trail of the more going up as launched and so we would hear of the latch and you couldn't see the guy's doing it because they were hidden behind buildings but he'd see that more to trail going up in this guy and you'd hear the watches come on come and then you just wait because it's coming and i remember i was on a roof top with one of my seal bodies and he was the automatic weapons gunner and these roofage weird they had these basically like concrete squares all over that wore three or four feet deep they are probably five foot by five foot this whole roof top was five foot by five foot concrete squares and we had gone out on this roof coping walked over to the far end and it took us a couple of minutes and we got there and we were set up and sitting there with him and we hear that noise then we see the launch of these mores and you look at me and he goes you think we could make it back inside meaning you think if we got a bran owe ran all the way back across the roof top back down the stairs which you get inside the building where you're going to be safe and i said no we're not going to make it back and he said oh what are we going to do and i said ordinaire and cateland he said do you think it'll kill us and i said no as long as it doesn't land in our quad trick right here meaning as little five by five which would have you know obviously killed us but i remember so we we endured this night i say you the word and durndest rong word we went we went through the night we got more good to bunch and ar remember thinking the next day we all got back and it was early this is early in my first to put his on any this is the first time any us had been under fire or any of that and we ever was little jumpy limit jumpy and i remember thinking that those guys are world war one that had died months and months and moans of indirect fire like mortar fire and there something that if you want to know what it does to people go on you two and gogora for a world war one shell shock and you see these soldiers that are so completely psychologically scared from that and it's a it's an eye open and the other really caporale thing about this was in world war one this pontion of petisson scaring a inexist if you broke down mentally there was only one word for you and it was toward so they these guys i mean it was just a gesting mare and again as why world war want is he to me is the most the most vicious and atrocious of of the wars who is that those with you that one asking him you know is a goin a get a the it will wantergo'n'show and if the all say who have living good body mind he yet we were just out out there looking at each other she led stupid waiting to get blown along to those take when when you hear the tontos were probably a a minute of light time to a series we'd hear three you know two or three of them and the other funny thing that night was a one of my other super paranoid ah brothers who is always like thinking it was the lad a b and that guy on one of those new hear the launches and e comes up the radio uta's three boys counou anyone we are free lances sir wig portree explosions in olinto to it but um an you know again i'm sinnerton of los will a night for us in those guys that were there on that for they were there to night they renardet mordred every night and it's just one of those you know thing on that first upon it we traveled around a lot so we'd go and be it some weird outpost and were like guenin apocalyps now and then the next day you'd be at the the starbucks on on base and on on one of the firm basis so it was very severy strange for us but the war is very different for different people depending on a where you are what your job is and that's why you know you always hear me give her a speck and props to all the soldiers the marines that were out there in the field far and they can have any opportunity to come back and and take a rap off ever they were just in it all the time just elspeth most part we generally would have some kind of a situation where we could get back and take a rap off not always though i mean akerat off meaningly last like like like restringamur the game all bit but you know not that being said you don't remote was so very concentres sure like that and the guys that were out the coregent getting more terancing gun every night basically um and it was you know same thing so again i i i never want to make anything that i've been through or even that we've been through in the modern era comparatio want to put that on the pedestal or oreville mex to what the guise in other wars have been through because you know every war has its thing whatever its thing was for andy know i just i just don't ever want to throw a chantry to compare that i'm distantly simple experiences and i'm saying that though guys in warm war on and what they went through i can't even fathem what that was like you know knowing just what a little bit of it feels like a little tiny tiny fraction of it no what the he feels like compared to what i must have felt like day after day after a week after week after month after mariton get some idication as to what that felt like like i said go and watch world war one shell shock videos and a how completely psychologically scared these guys were and it's awful offulest going back to the book and this is the same subject when a soldier lies under hostile fire and waits he feels unable to protect himself he at he has time he thinks he only waits for the shot that will hit him he feels a certain inferiority to the enemy he feels that he is alone and deserted that's what we're talking about here now always i like to tideshead from war back to life then i think that this denis very accursio get into two modes in their life modeen offensive and there are making things happened and modes whether defensive and things are happening to them and they will enter having to react and i think that those psychology think about any one thinks about their life and when times were good it when they were on the offensive i mean think about financially when you when you were doing good you got to pay bills paid off and everything's going well and how you just you if you'll go about it you feel finance was cure and you feel like all i can make heap and and then you think about the time is near life i spent twenty years the altar you're not highly paid in the military you think about time in your life where you didn't have a lot of money and how that feels completely different olfsen when you're walking down the street and you see something to back god that i doesn't even have a job with a asgeirson you start to get that that feeling whereas the times your life where you save up money and your dowell then you you feel a lot better to same thing physically you know with the more you go on the offence with your health and with your diet the better you feel menwygent taken down by a sickness or an injury or laziness you let one of those things take you down all of a sudden everything is negative and that that's why i think this relates very well that when you lay under hostile fire and wait i feel unable to protect yourself so eagles into a quick story here i remember one day in nineteen sixteen in russia during the night we relieved the austrians on the following morning the russians began a heaved artery preparation meaning they started bombing the crap out of em we were unfamiliar with the terrain we had no idea what troops on arriver left we did not know what artillery we had i was alone with my company in the midst of an austrian battalion i didn't know my superiors the russian said ben firing for two hours but our artillery didn't reply i went constantly from dug out to dug out to see and speak to my men they should at least see that they were not alone repeatedly they asked me are we really entire lone here haven't we any artillery it continued this way for hours our telephone wires had been shot to pieces finally a tremendous noise came from our rear our own artillery was firing at once high spirits returned the soldiers no longer felt deserted each could see and hear that our side was doing something now each saw that he was being supported and that every one was ready to repulse the attack in great defensive battles one will constantly hear the remark when the enemy are two areas firing where is our own artillery and everybody speriences that kind agitase thing with your report of a team of your part of company and things are starting to go backwards people immediately focus on the negative the immediately focus on the nevernever when you're on the defensive and when you are being attacked every one starts turning on each other almost and where's our artaria happens and then to to to refer that trend you know when something posenian also in people start feeling positive gain so it's important to be aware that and recognized a enlock for those sins and it's also important not the just detour part of a team but to detach yourself from yourself and see where is happening to you as an individual when sang start to go negative are you amplifying the negativity cause that happens m we do that now he goes on to talk about it is different during the attack here the soldier himself a he asked to do something he moved forward he fires the assault and dictate the action of the enemy at a moment of the attack he never asks wears artillery from the beginning of the attack he feels himself the victor he storms forward he believed he can do everything by himself he needs no support as soon as he attacks loaned it slows down the cry for artillery is heard again so this is a psychological thing when people are attacking they feel better they feel like they're going to win an that's why that mentality of attacking is so important you hear this in you have seafire people say be first deferat literally the coach i'll hear that from every coach in enamelled be first be first there wanting the ter fight or to initiate the attack and not beyond it as if now you do get some fighters that are really good counterpanes and that's understandable it's a that's another than but only dorty it's be first you know attack first got on the offensive and were always trying to cure people to do that yet indite if you if you stay hand of the guyonnet even if he gave kind of better than you you do stay ahead whom that folk is on that because it's like he has to make up ground tenyan you know do his game and be better than you but you have your consentient almost like you don't have time to to yes to be offensive and into weiner to be you know in the in the black you are always in the red you got to get out the red fire you know and if you can to like i said stayed at the guy keep yourself in the black have this advantage even like i said if you even a little better than your bigger whatever yes it's such a um a weird dynamic there where he wergeland even were diarmait's just a reality but you here's the deal if you are on the attack you are to a better sea you are an the offence your psychologically winning and he has used a huge him back and if you're on the defence your psychologically losing your man and to this the poor things ofering with some one and almost unyoke your star getting negative in your mind your getting down in ated just say yourself oh you know what's happening right now okay i'm just i'm just cameniata here so let's not worry about that let's figure out to get back on the offence but you can't double down on on your negativity and you're already getting dominated position wise don't double down on your negativity when somebody gets in positive position on me a better position on me one care and like i'm dislike oh call you you got mounted your cross eyed whatever good to his new or cold sandy cause i'm goin to come back he is i don't let it get to me psychologically yeah hellicat the book this desired act is in my opinion the reason why soldiers go so willingly on patrol i repeat that this is extremely difficult to lie in hostility because one feels exposed a blind chance on patrol was different the soldier feels that his destiny rests in his own hands he feels that he is not dependent on blind fate that he is not forced to go this were that but can do pakenhams desire what to do he feels that he controls the situation for example he may think that path over the hill seems dangerous to me i don't know why but i have that feeling most definitely therefore i prefer to go through the valley he has the feeling that his actions the pens on his own will and in consequence he can act in accordance with that will say message but from a leadership possession how do you give your people that ability to be on offers and that's what you want to constantly look for how can you get them on offers now this is going back into a little bit of what we talked about on the lot last podcast and that's mission type orders and an in this run bontecou it mission tactics in the german army we used we use what we term mission tactics orders not written out in the minutest detail a mission is merely given the commander how it shall be carried out is his problem this is done because the company commander on the ground as the only one who concretely judge existing conditions and take proper action of a change occurs in situation there is also a strong psychological reason for these mission tactics the commander who can make his own decisions within the limits of this mission feels that he is responsible for what he does consequently he will complish more because you will act in accordance with his own psychological individuality give this same independence to your protonihilates it is certainly evident from training in peace that there is that the more freedom aloud a subornation in his training that better result will be why because he is made responsible for results and allowed to achieve them in his own way boom there is again and in life was at me to take a personal initiative in your life being controlled be first line your life lead your life people use that you say oh you got to lead your own life and i'm unionalls unendowered er of your life you need to lead your life no be reactive egressive and going back to the psychology piece and back to the book again from funchal we know that psychology is tremendously important in war it is a field on thelemite in extent to which every conscientious soldier should give much time and study and that's you know that's one of the things that i find about dogs that it is also onlimited in extent it doesn't stop you don't you don't ever get to the end of that learning process and that's why we're always trying to be better and that's why we still make mistakes that's why you still make mistakes in leadership as it that's why i who sit around teach about leadership and tell people how to lead i make mistakes do things wrong and treat somebody the wrong way and make em mad and i got to go back and unwind that that's what happened so we got a dose much as we can to learn as much as we can yet it cannot be coacto the book yet it cannot be learned as one learnt mathematics it must be sensed unfortunately we cannot formulate a set of psychological rules human reactions can never be reduced to an exact science or is governed by the uncertain and unknown and the least known factor of all is the human element and i think that's that's what i like about this that the fact that war is governed by the uncertain in the unknown in a least known of all factor is the human element and war again or as i like and that's why i think when you hear these stories in these philosophies about the psychology of war you appoint yourself and you need your own warm you you detach yourself psychology you detach yourself and you observe and you see how these psychological elements are affecting you and what and what you can do to straighten them out come men the asters and i only often to the defence that's a huge question we should check with ourselves every day and what's if you're on the defence what's putting you on the defense and how are you go back on the orchis you think a lot of people with them we get asked a lot about doing task and how do you get stuff done every day i think there's some people that their task less the list of things to do makes them defensive they go all a got so much to do and i at the whim of this list where you wake up an he say no no i moonoons about about that list i've got clear targets this is a target lest and i know exactly what i have to do to knock them out that is what i am going to go do that that simple change in attitude that so leadership is critically important on your machines that that you're in that situation of less you detach into sane thing with your team is the same thing with your your company and the same thing with you personally you cannot be so engrossed in the problem that you don't see what's happening to yourself so that's a little bit from that leadership captain aid of vansell a smart an observant person that taught me a lot and i much appreciate his dogs so that the raptor that book and now it's time for unquestioned that we've got from the internet from twitter from face book and appreciative one sen in this question it kitenre questions so question number one questionable one am okay how important is mentoring in your experience in your opinion and in all its or whatever what is the key points well in doing it mentoring in noses this is asked in two ways right cause how inportance is mean trying to be mentor is very important une to sockdologer of people as much as you can and lean as much you can from people and find good men to use that are umgaroos with their knowledge if that's very important in the essays be looking for good mentors to help teach you and then as far as mentoring other people that is also a key in one of the things i find about mentoring other people is that that is your legacy that is what you have behind in for instance i was in the seal teams for twenty years which sounds like a long time but the sultan has been around for over sixty years and there the southem is not me at all i'm a tiny miniscule fraction peace of the celts and but what was in you leave this you opens you don't leave anything the only thing that you do you don't even thing of yourself the only thing close that you do easthope that you meant to and the people that you raised and that's why you need to take great care when you meant to people to make sure that your doing a job and raising people right and one of the unresting things about mentorship is that you have to let go of your ego because what you should have want as a mentor what you should desire as a mentor is that your people that your mentoring become better than you that's your hope is that they do better than you a performed better than you i become better than you and you've got to be proud when that happens you know i i ah ingenue what i'm teaching people in our gian you know you get some somebody will say all i'm going to tap you out one day and i was say god i i hope you do you good i i oudame out because first of all i'm teaching you git and you get to work and so if you catch me in eugubian in a submission hold it is sore and i will be submitted so good if you're here in your learning from me and you never get me better than there's nothing wrong with the way in teaching you so should be the same thing in business it should be the same thing in life and the the weird thing too it is that it's hard to find people that want to be mentor in the life artist's hard a lot of young you know young younger people and i mean i'm only forty four but upset this before you on your forty when when you are twenty three o thinkin everything you really do and in when you're twenty seven you look back and you go mad i did know anything then but i know everything now and then when you're thirty three think oh when i was twenty seven i didn't know anything but i know everything now and eventually you reached a point you know when you are forward and you say oh when i was thirty five i didn't know anything and i still don't know anything and that sort of when you reach a good point your life where your mind becomes open well takes several years a beeman years for that to happen so if you can find some one that is really has opened mine and really wants to be ventured young age its awesome and you can really affect people in a positive way and i now had some great iterate enters some of those older ah season that i looked up to and said while this person really is done in assja those people help me out a lot in some bait was in a active mentoring it was more of an imitation you know i was just imitating what they did and trying to i didn't ye know i can't remember that many times when some one save down and said it so in years which you need to do to win i had didn't happen a lot but a lot of times they be said hay drop of people hers which you need to do to win and i was taken notes and making sure i remember what they were saying so yet meant ring is absolutely important and it's also a very positive thing you have in a positive impact on somebody's life and that ah that always feels good to watch them do well unless you have a big ego and rarity and in which case you you'll be miserable do you think that's kind of natural though the to say for an instructor point of view or or or whatever when you mean to resort unmitring situation and that person does start to plentycash up with you and i bet you do you think that that that's pretty as pretty common orritate summer resistance in your mind in generone yone has an ego you don't want to get tapped out by your students but if you let that drive you than you're not holdin your holding back in ferentino them and you're not pushing in to do better so it it might be a reality but it's reality that you have to deal with and you have to get rid of it's kind of like the growing pains of the of the group right of the unit to like if you have you know three students and or you mean academy of school and now they get better than you your school which is kinnor whole goal in your whole motivation your school is strong but if you're still the bowl to alphabetage you're individually strong in you go strong but your southwest growing samkin of part of it i i tell my guys all the time at the gym you know the better you are the better i am i have this also moved that's working wealth let me show you the counter so that i can learn to overcome the counter to the move and that's how we all get better next question m you say you keep your affectations of people in a low monious last time ah but do you ever call people out for being disrespectful or you know something like that this is it an interesting question and i i we thinking about this question and there's one thing about it at that is and i don't know if this is just be i don't know if i have a positive attitude i don't know but i i don't i don't see a bunch of disrespect like people aren't disrespecting me people aren't you know saying things to me that i find disrespect for it just doesn't really happen that much to you to me yenikeui like a serial killer and all that and and and that's fine and so the wife makes it a little bit of a of a tough question answer because i'll tell you that i believe that if you carry yourself certain way if you carry yourself respectfully and you respect other people not only will people not disrespect you but they will act as respectful in your presence and of course what am i telling people all the time i'm telling people the you know get up early until people to work out an tell people that thangyou people train boxing investing and moisic almost things help your confidence and when your confident and people look at you go that kind looks like he can handle himself i think i'm going to show some respect in his vicinity so i think it's i think it's um kind of a carryover of of your presence and how you carry yourself and and the main pontianus if you are respectful to other people when you treat other people respectfully unless you have some one that istimele jerk they're not going to just come up in carbisdale to you now on the interweb and in this where i got queshtum he cut his kind of come back and i have to read through the questions again but you know he basically got into some kind of a incident when he sticking up for some one and then that's different you know now some one sees if i see some one's getting bored you know ye i might stick up i might stick up for them sometimes i think to myself was not person sticking up romeles you know it that person as to stand up for themselves so there is kind of an interesting dynamic but again i think when when you carry yourself for us withersteen confidence not cockiness but just with respect and confidence in who you are and what you do i think that most people are going to go to be respectful when they are your presents and i i usually i mean i give respect to people and i usually get respect and i see people acting respectfully for when i'm around as i pologize it that dozen soul the problem for some one that is you know be seen dis disrespect all the time and i think the water you carry yourself you give an impression that you're locent up with this respect as well so i think it's about presence i think it's about giving respect in and things not having confidence and i think that eliminates a lot of that um need to call people out for being disrespectful next question so you do a lot of strength work fraser work out come let us strength work ah do you do any ah stretching or mobility stuff im you know isn't it important especially a no for benaglia or the actual question says especially for an age dugouts but that a place the kind of everybody though all were all aging or are set when i can feel like this was directed at vera as an old man and a tattoo four im an a in juitler now of course it on jim we have guys that are fifty and sixty years old that i wroth and they roll with the young studs and everything else so as an aging is a relative term were al aging ah the bottom line here yea absolutely stretching them abillement e e i should do more i don't do enough that being said i will say that a lot of the movements that i do involve mobility in their own right for instance when i do squats a squat a veway to the bottom and so people are surprised at my hip nobility because i squat with heavy weights on my back and i go over weight down into the foul squat position so i'm relatively flexible mayhaps a youknow you do muscle ups and you know you're getting really good mobility work in your shoulders same thing with ring tatman that any the ring i i'm on ring all the time as you get a lot of mobility and strengthening of those little muscles and keeping them healthy so i do some pretty good there that being said you know i i know i should do more and whenever i get some kind of an injury this is a a bad policy you know i get injured in that i do mobility orso know i should do the other way round said one of those things that i need to increase my discipline on an so i need to improve the amount of mobility work that i do um it's one of those things that i don't find that enjoyable and i don't find it that satisfying even though it does feel good i mean i joy to pain of it but i don't i don't feel those results like i want to it and so techotl wouldn't he reasons wide don't do enough of it but ah you know you can see sometimes you know i'll i'll some hamsa have to take a day where i just do nothing but mobility in the donothing but grind out miserae because i'm so sore after nine days straight in like okay i can't take this any more than my body will start to tell me dude you need to stretch out and take a day off so i do that you'll mobility mobility and with a with kelly stared and and his book the supple leaped and you know i have that and when i have some something going on i'll dig into that book or dig into those videos and find out what i need to do to grind that browbeat and and i love to him that i love to get in on that when when i need to but any do more yet interesting um i e kinnahan that question a lot like it since do you get through do you do mobility training your you get to his mobility manatou doris so you try to there's something the old do anything so you get to and den come times will say this here he'll be like all kay if you're going to if you're a runner what's the best way to train is to run no so if you're jugeait besetting too and that goes for conditioning sufistic condition but so it like if you like if you're in the guard of the close guard in your tunnel hold it close guard and your training fight even five days a week but you're in or a high you're at the onobatis add oughter muscles are gonna get a lot of training yes now i will say this you know you look at like the tenth planet system and adiba and i mean they they really focus on flexibility becomes a great aspect of their game and i definitely respect that um i also do think it some people that go sycharth to go and stretching cacadore damage than good you know i've known i knew some guys along the way that got really into yoga and as the years went on i think it was debilitating for them you know your your spine and your muscles are supposed to stretch to a certain point and when you start stretching them beyond that yet i in my opinion start doing montego now i'm not even close to that not this is no experience this is no lanham orenian it i don't know the anger of seeing too much so but i just didn't want filetto there that some i think you can i think you can overdo it and you can go into these extreme positions that are not good for you any more in an adaptably one of my one of my seal bodies who was a very indeafour fifteen years and he is messed up on and he said he a you know i think the main reason is cause i went too far with the gas he with it with everything i got to find him ippolita think that um especially if you're doing it in reference to your dugouts but it's going to depend on your game like you mention attempt planet is tom if you're in if you like the tenth minister that's your your thing um she improve your flexibility that's going to be a big asset compared to your dead less but if you have a different type of system where it may be oggimai guy a bigger guy or something his school as i can't machete gush maskinonge senachies on top you're as set orginalite maybe some strength may be some balance duff to moreland submission is just depends on what game you want greatly but either way when you just when you do just you get to it in any capacity you're doing mobility stuff ye true and at the same time will bility training otherwise does how pursuits kind o like a two a street affirmed you think you can have too much on your plate and how you handle multiple tasks well this is a question articulated this mostly exact same question and persia do you can you end up with you much stuff on your place yes you absolutely can that being said before i go down the road of a cat too much my place it is you probably not do good time management you know you probably sleep an lay your probably not focus you probably all the interweb when you should be getting work done you're probably listening to you know a music while you're trying to work in getting distracted it so as all the strings that we go like that so much in my platoon you've too much on your play you're just not focussed when you need to be you just not getting you you're just not attacking the problems and so was the easiest thing to a t oh i figure that too much my plan in to get rid of em stuff you know so the there there's something that eat with this example have you ever had something were it something that's going to take you like twenty minutes but it hangs over your head for a month and it becomes this sucker of men mental easy mental powers how many of those things do you have at how many can you actually deal with before it search a ruminated losing your focus patient not so these little twenty minute has your half an hour a task that you don't do because you put him off in pregassona those the ones get those things down away okay you have to much stuff on your plate go get some of losings off your plate they take a half an hour there's so many things you can get down in a half an hour if you just get all them that that that's how that's one way to clip your plate so that's my first piece of answering this is is likely it's not that you have too much in your plate it's just that you need to focus gadgets stuff done you need to quit wasting time now that being said if you are truly taxed which is it definitely happens if you are truly taxed to what you do well never one priorities this is a back to the book extreme ownership one of the chapter is one of the laws of combat is is priories souyou got to take whatever all these things that you have to get done and put them in priority order an start to take care of the highest party first and go and and dat's what you need to do another thing you can use you can delegate um if you got a tea or you got somebody you could hire you got some on the clou out you delicate and say you know what i hear i caterino this do this all ye me fifty bucks all give me ten bucks i'll do something that's easy for me to do like a you know some task that i'm good old for you you do this for me so delicate or higher somebody to help you or the last thing as you can say no you people not to do more stuff say no to him lest i can't do that eroticis your right now so that's my cut on can you have too much stuff on your plate and how do you endless long board or short board ah asserting question go i definitely like to serve i serenas often as the waves are good and as far as long board or short board i serve both long board and short board and you know from me at la giorno gee i mean what's what would a people on the mat have on that's one of an impotent what i'm to get on and see and with a wave of the waves are good for sore for a short boromeans portage out and if the wages are good for long boardotrade longerene same thing i like to very my training i mean so that i'm more well rounded across the board and i can handle more different situations so and i enjoyed both of em all lot see how surfing questions are like pretty liner i benmost sports questions are pretty liner compared jujitsu did you this freaking ma'am it roasted of it and the directions that it can go are so crazy yanyenge they could be argued that tirfing could have that but it's not as obvious you know he inanimate been going to like a philosophical thing ye or anamabu but but you could go down the philosophical path of judicature going to go saeter if not marie as only eaether something crazy about you guineas it is very like an um care what that quo was to night from voshell but just how it's the psycho the psychology of people is infinite and always changing and always different a meter similarities yet infinite always changing different with every person you will with a every person to deal with psychological defender person you will with has a different little thing in their game and you never know how the old react to your movements so as why psychologically it such a good training methodology in him how has your military training effected your training flesh coaching of jugs i e more structure said a well interestingly i would say that my military training has made me want to be less structured been digitaria be one to be less structured in military the military the the experiences of combat made me want to make training less structured because again it goes back to we talked about last week i want to train people's minds to be ready for situations that they don't expect a training the mind is more important than training the body now that being said of course you have to have you have to have a certain level of of standard operating proceeded yet have a certain level of knowledge so injudicious got a mature that people have those basic a knowledge that the base i shan't hiasinth fund of mental knowledge you now be reseestin the sithean we would teach different tactics and for a while we were saying basic tactics of hay you need to stick with the basic tactics and i said look these aren't basic tactics these are fundamental tactics and that the same thing with ouivitari aren't they're not basic their fundamental to the game and in everything else is built upon those um so i would say that my my faghard you git you training or not more structure to less structured and in and also in terms of the style of environment i like to be in i like it probably is unstructural as i mean there's definitely some structure but i can like it to be overly structured i would rather have people with the mind set of self discipline rather than imposed discipline so another words to you my students must do as i command and otherwise you will be punished at that imposed discipline and that's not one i'm looking for that doesn't expand people's brains it doesn't make people smarter or able to think differently about situations in that it it in traps their brain so i want people to have an open mind when they're trying to his ontimetta their own ideas i don't want them to fall on my dears i want them to follow i want them to spring board off of my ideas and then i want them to give them a their ideas back to me so i can spring bore off their ideas that's how you expand your game and get better and you know that means chaos and training i mean starting in different positions that means using different pacing you know let's do freeman foot to one man around fort though twenty men around sittell these different scenarios they get you ready for different situations let's use gee let's use no gelett do put me maloes on let's hit each other lets you each other during takened mix it up so our brain is constantly trying to or a costly adapting to situations that it didn't expect m that's my b j j training felipe ye you'd think obviously you're a you know does military that obviously you take care class and you are going to be saying yes sir no sir and but yet kind of the opposite it might experience do i i'm verteth not to impose let us thencomes in late if you about that come on on the mat i'll show amiston better than the ainai mean yah definitely better lock comin along but i mean iyeyoshi that these guys that have a work that have jobs they they they working they got wives and kids and charaxes guy shows up late for class thanks for coming man i appreciate it gether let's all sosimenes roll yet you know i'm not thinking that the guistinani organization that is missing is movement to go on in a soulter's the guasima a got a life and digitus he there trained so let's help him drink yea god do you ever fail to wake up early i do you ever wake up it you know five yet you grease and if you do what you do immediately a right when you get a ocifers do i reveiled get arly yes he answers yes it does happen and as soon as you know if i wake up now if i wake up and i so go you know i slept late you i have multiple alarm fox now so so if it's a critical situation if i had a light to catch it not those laticlave all all charged some ready to fire he um some therefore there's no sleeping through a situation like that like a cannot happen it's never happened to me he a but if it's a it a indade' not do anywhere and it's a sunday and i set my own cockfoot four thirty and i you know in the dread of a nightmare i wake up in a turned off in the night side ohagwa and lay by a bacon and almost on my way up in its five or six thirty or whatever i slept in so immediately i feel gifest you know because i be gilt is because i know i missed a great part of my day you know i know that i missed the morning i know i miss the sunrise and and i'm addicted to that feeling of seeing that he in soato miss it if you sell bad and once you get in that train of where you are you did you so that i become becomes addictive you love to be up on its dark you love to see the sunrise come up you love to have your day started in a very very positive feeling if feels really good to do that and so when you miss it it's like you you you went backwards and i definitely makes you feel bad and for me personally you know i mean and and you know there's a lot of guys that didn't come back that didn't don't have the opportunity get up early that don't have the opportunity to see every day and make something good happen and so i feel guilty that i'm letting those guys down to and you know doujat to ah you want to live up a positive life that's worthy of their sacrifice and and when you don't you feel guilty about it and and of course there's sometimes that i should do this more often when you know my body does need more sleep and use the i try make that mean that i go to bed earlier rather than rather than waking up later on said that we you keep your sleep patterns organized but you know some of his hard life gets in the way and you stay up late and ah i know there's a lot of folks and there's a lot of medical proof that says that i should sleep more and we also three on and that's something i'd like to try out sodomoni my life just netawis not now an get though a fideque how do you take leadership over yourself you know do same principles apply and you know as the different well out first fall missie this question came from a a guy on the interweb named amos kragendorf's real name or maybe name as crag amos i don't know he's got a a an twitters at d a m o e r and what what was funny what made this question stand out was he made a outoi of him playing a costituente so if you look up on you to a most crag and maas crageen it's like a song about jackaway he gets a lot of ah egotist of me and set of the folks at watches it's tactually a catchy soft it is like if you play it like if you're just playing at you didn't know jack with a duckle willing keep be like a this kind of a cool little illum like a kind of full cleaning yeah so you you made that song it's like i said it's funny checked out umisk of weird to cause you know no one over donothing weardale make a song and we abutments gondafer too i had to get over the weirdness part at first i was like all i like this this is bizarre but ah but then he seems like toy good dedannan time so good on him ah yes question how do you take your how do you take leadership over yourself to the same principles apply ours at different and we are actually talk about this a lot to day with an shell and they the answer is clearly yes that is what we are talking about to day and the you the thing about leading yourself as you have to be able to detach till bed yourself and when you detach if you can detach from inside your brain than you can become your own leader and that is where you start to make progress a tame without a leader dozen do well so if you're a human and you don't have leadership of yourself or knocking to do as a well as you could if you are leadership position but the principles are the same with leadership whether he yourself eveline i mean things like having simple clear goals and at being disappointed in that discipline within the team over the yourself equally more freedom we just talked about prioritize behappen with a team it happens with an individual ownership taking extreme eldership if you're in a team you take wondership of your promise and every one takes ownership of the promise within the team that they saw those problems will guess what if you are a person and you are leading yourself and you take ownership of wind mistakes happen then guess what you can solve those problems if all you do say all it's not my fault be severne's fault no you're never going to solve problems but if you take oneship of wind things going bad then you can fix them so the principles are the same you have to lead yourself you are your own leader and you know we open to day with a i have heavy poem and a conversation about a guy upon was called a rendezvous and while that is a roarin it's noble when it's couragious an an actually guess what we all have run evoided there's no escaping that in this trip were on it a short one but instead of thinking about that rendevouses let's instead focus on a randyvow destiny and that a phrase that not you hear it and it ate sounds amosoro line corny and i'll tell you why it doesn't to me because i worked with a group in iraq called the first of the five six pariander first arterburn vision and it was one of their sayings that came all the way back from wenda when the unit was stood up for world war two and the the major general a ginmills lee he said that wall the hundred first has no history it hasn't roundabout destiny and fateful bettina the hundred first airborne division fulfilled that desnoyer and over again during de day during the battle of bows during the siege of base and you know what when i was remade they fulfilled that destiny again the first the five six that band a brothers so think about that rondevoo the vandevelde with the ranee would destiny and make the most alport that you have through dissipline through hard work to fousand drive a most importantly that you are responsible for the past you take front waste time with things that don't matter get in the game get in the gem get to work get to living this is your life idiot led your life lead it how you want to lead it every second of every day take that leadership of your life matocton so everyone out there thanks for listening thank you very much for spraying a word and most of all thank you forgetting after it this us jaconite next time it
