this is jacopo cast number eight with the others and me joe welling good evening ah good evening they nineteen fifty two a young marine robert a ganin arrived on shore at incan caria where he was going to be shipped north to fight and he gathered a head north he saw stacks of sea bags fiches like a military duffle bag he some sitting in the rain no one had to explain what they were doing there why they belonged to marines that had been killed on the front he wrote this poem years later about seeing those sand bag seeing those sea bags piled high when clouds are grey and lowering and fog obscures the plan i sometimes think i catch a sight of sea bags in the rain i know it is a vision to ethereal to last but it brings a whisp of sadness and a haunting of the past we had come ashore at insane in nineteen fifty two and administrative landing just a unit passing through we mustered at the rail head lining up to board a train when through the stormy darkness i saw sea bags in the rain there was no need to question why they were lying there looking lonely and abandoned in the damp clean air their owners had gone northward and would not return again from where hells of bitter battle took the lives of fighting men now in fog and darkness gather i rarely can restrain my sadden thought of in john and see bags in the rain to imagine that year a young rene to as joined emarine core and your fired up and you have the visions of glory and that romantic vision in your mind of what war is going to be like and you get to care and it's an administrative ending so there's no shooting going on and you're you're now you're on the ground and you're in cream and then you must or to go north and go to the battle field go to the front and you see these sea bags of all these marines having killed and combat and you can imagine what that does psychologically to guise and obviously to ah robert a gain in it affects him affected him his whole life and he still thinks about it and as much of an intense experience as that is the marine corps has been walking past those bags you know theoretically walking past to those bags for over two hundred years and going forward going into the fray towards the rest towards in many cases towards death and i'm kind of leading in with talking about the marine court to night oh i have just absolute respect for dedicates more inquiry we worked closely with them when we were lebody and two thousand six mostly with the the three eight marines were as the third battalion eight marine regiment and they were there for the bulk of the deployment with us then they got relieved by the one six marines who arrived towards the end of our cruise and be prior that my whole career i was working with marines i was gomuti le shipboard deployments with marines i did a turn over with the first maracapana bagdad and two thousand and four so i know marines well and like i said they just have my absolute respect and as a warrior class which is what they are a warrior class of men o women there professionalism and their commitment it is its impact and because they fought you know in all major wars they know an understand combat very well and therefore they know and they understand come at leadership very well and with that we are going to look to night at what used to be called the f m f m one tacker that was defeat marine force manual which is now called the m c w p the marine care war fighting publication six tackle even and the title of the of the document is called leading marines and so what i did as a kind of like i do with most of these books that we look at i went through it in found the pieces that struck me as highly applicable to combat which make them highly applicable to life and to business and to the way we through this world so i've pulled some of these ideas out some quoth out some sections out to talk about and discuss and here we go imagine you are riflemen in a company ready to assault a line of enemy machine gun bunkers you are lying flat on the ground protected verdomme by a slight rise between you and the enemy but just above your head the unmet the enemy's guns are throwing a visible and audible curtain of lead which thudded into the trees round you causing you to wonder if it makes the same sound with it its flesh you tell yourself it impossible impossible to penetrate that curtain of fire alive yet in a moment a sergeant's voice will boom let's go you can't live for ever but all you hear now as the clatter of machine guns the vision of dead and wounded us so on the way up to the front rises to play you your belly deflates and lies flat against your backbone and all the gallant thoughts you would hope to have at this moment are gone you are naked and alone with the instinct of self preservation and that's what soldiers and marines face not all of them but many of them and they in these situations and situations even worse than this they do decide to go forward they decide go fortino that maestro of fire and of death and soldiers and warriors have done that for thousands of years and you ask yourself and a purpose that they wrote that paragraph was so that vaccinate question why and here's what them recourse as about it why do individuals rush forward against their ma most basic instincts why do marines take their lives in their hands and lead a charge straight into enemy guns in old war two one was it that made reintegrator out of their landing clasps landing craft into water of unknown depth and charge into a hail of machine gun and artillery fire not knowing whether they were ever make it to the beach in vietnam what was it that made a marine takes a point and start down the dark and misty jungle trail at the heart of wiriness able to put mission accomplishment over concerned for their own safety is leadership leadership that is the combination of the intangible elements of our ethos and the more tangible elements of our leadership philosophy so there saying that this curragh comes from the leadership and from the ethos that they live that is that is brought to the troopers through the leadership which is a pretty profound statement so very profound statement and i jumped out of this manual for ome and i grabbed sort of the ring corporaneous of leadership their key words here they are justice judgment depend melody initiative decisiveness that integrity in theism bearing on selfishness courage knowledge loyalty endurance those of the traits that they talk about and one i actually from that list i think they're all pretty pretty obvious why there are that less the one exception or i would say the one that stands out to me a little bit as may be what people were expected back yes i didn't think tactical or tactics i said tact and they actually go on to defy that a little bit further the definition of tact is the ability to deal with others in a manner that will maintain good relations and avoid offence more simply stated practiseth ability to say and do the right thing at the right time so obviously almost every time we sit down at this pot cast table and do our work here we end up somehow talking about the interactions between human beings and he actually put this as a one of their tenants is that you have to have packed the the quality of consistently treating peers seniors and subordinates with respect and courtesy is a sign of maturity that allows commands guidance and opinions to be expressed in a constructive and beneficial manner this deference must be extended under all conditions regardless of true feelings regardless of true feelings there say you have despite the fact that that person a noise you or the think you could do a better job or all those things that we talk about regularly here you have to have tact regardless of your true feelings you know like one you know people rude people for example millville say stuff like hay it was true you know they say something that's rude or whatever and they'll be like he am i speak the truth if you don't like it ennatha's like lack of captain i've always even i've always thought that where you always wonder why those people aren't in leadership position approbatory don't have tact he is who wants to be around somebody that acts like he and what's interesting about as you know one of the other words they have ponders integrity right and yet there saying that you know regardless of your true feelings so there is a little bit of ida of a dicotomy there you know and to be the person that as well as true somut going to say it right no tact should override integrity in dealing with people and human emotions yet and it that kind of whatever was thought when i hear people say rude things and be like oh it it's okay for me to say these kinds of kinds of things because they're true even though attenuation but they kind o it's cloaked in this like presentation that their just being honesty know so the yeastiness how its other saying the tack over rides that quatiunt honesty the umboo the for the sake of leadership or the group or whatever no doubt about it um should i was we get into this in what leaders what leaders are actually leading against now of course there's not a your others a force that supposing you so your leading against them but they have another word that adores friction and this is something for anybody that knows anything about sort of military science understand understands and is hurt to word friction before and it's a word that comes from carl von clausewitz who was a great prussian trend of general born in seventeen eighty fought in rhine campaigns in an apollonic wars was a famous military forest and he wrote the famous book von cray which means on war said that was his that was his sort of master piece that he wrote in its well read by anybody in the military it has read on or by cossets so friction is a term that he coined as far as i know it's a term at he corned i haven't read it prior to him and it is of about friction here is what caused fits says about it and this is from on an then again i departed from the marine cormenu here for a few minutes to go a little bit deeper into friction everything is very simple in war but the simplest thing is difficult these difficulties accumulate and produce a friction which no man can imagine exactly is not seen war so when war through an influence of an in an infinite of petty circumstances which cannot properly be described on paper things disappoint us and we shall win we fall short of the rank so this idea friction is all the little things that build up against you and against what your trying to accomplish and i love what he says next a powerful irwell overcomes this friction it crushes the obstacles so your will can overcome them and but there's a but as a caveat but certainly the machine along with them so your iron will can smash these obstacles but it does take a toll on the will the strong will of a proud spirit stands prominent and commanding in the middle of the art i war and will get to will a little bit later for right now we're talking about freching activity in war is movement of an a resistant medium so it's it's you know as opposed to doing stuff on the ground in the air you do meet water or you doing it and allow us you in something that is slow you down an stop he it is therefore this friction or what is so termed the hour which makes that which appears easy in war difficult reality and i will tell you in working with all kinds of companies and businesses there's fritzinger business there's friction everything at every gold that people have in a business world there is friction and resistance to trying to stop me from getting there and obviously that just slides right over and to your life and those goals that you have and your fighting in his friend what is this britannis fried everything is everything that is stopping you from achieving your go and in war it's what the enemy does it's the weather it's a lack of ammunition it's the it's a material that you need them arriving in time it's a muddy road it's a stroke a strong wind is all the usual limital things is the weird attitude of your subordinates it's the it's the mental capacity of your leadership is all these things create is fricandeau from a chevrier at least it's going to try to stop you from naigues and it's the same thing when you get a business that's trying to make something happen you know when you go to formulate a business this is not an easy process this is a challenge of processerit on that comes up against you and obviously like i said with your personal goals we see friction all the time now that marine corn a year is there take it that was some crossed and it was a little bit of a bridge version but you know i'm a bridging so this one is the marine corn and you'll notice a little bit more clarity because it's retire tly in english by marines so it's it's clearer and here is the marine court take on friction friction dominates war it makes simple tasks harrd accostable to tear down the will of the individual marine and interferes with eunices it operates across the entire spectrum of conflict from garrison activities to combat from senior command elements down to the most forward fighting position so the friction is everywhere it everywhere it's on the front line troopers are feeling fraction you don't the the senior command has friction that to innistore tin can be loss of concavity you know your sitting there on the all the inortet when you are trying to communicate with troops at her afield nowadays that internet goes down there fractionary broad band cable gifts stuff up it he literally that's rich everything is friction friction to be caused by external factors such as physical environment the nature of the mission or friendly or enemy action inadequate or inaccurate intelligence also contributes to friction by causing uncertainty this uncertainty is sometimes called the fog of war where things are not always what the leader expected this express this expression describes both a literal fog created by dust smoke and debris on the battle field and more importantly the mental fog of confusion and uncertainty created by lack of knowledge of the enemy chaotic noise mental and physical fatigue and fear and interestingly but late night that the book that we wrote extreme oneship the the first chapter he is called the forearm anaitis and and i talk about this fact right here it was the literal fagger cause it was burning tires in the streets creanciers where in the as concrete dust floating through the air and smoke from machine guns and and smoke from smokerings and to the elite fagaloa see in the oncomparable feredia fog were nightingale was i wasn't sure what was happening and so this frugal is so very real frictions most aleator it's most leeful form however is self induced and may be turned internal rection so this again it's just incredible how these furies of war parallel life and otoyo have these things that are going on in your world that are trying to stop you from but giving your goals the most leaf of formers of friction in self induced its watch you do to yourself and fear of the unknown breeds this paralysis it is best overcome by vigorous leadership which clearly sets out what is happening how it is happening and most importantly why is wide as happening so again it is almost i don't know if it's some point of monasta being surprised and stop being shocked and stop being stop being amazed in it in the parallel between for war and life and this is just one of them another one of em to the thiselton friction yes a bin a big one that i've kind o noticed in i think it most people have this is his pet peace in all you people have these pet pies about like for example when people call me boss you know youenne say hey what's out you you rouseabout an eatless first on cast yes so ele said frechette ho charles yes and this coysel indeed so means anything bad by the word pass but meanwhile like i have this little almost like check against them you know because they referred to me as postor deed i don't know why do not actually in it if a girl hoped me dod it's like it's it seems real condescending even though i i figured they don't but that could jam up the relationship and potentially gem up any kind of you know task we have that can be disgust one little element saigement pesin general one'll give him people's wit ye have served stupid and in my opinion sir you he did correct yourself wieheisstes we could we it is set here and the rest of his pocatoligo ing up with the various frictions and life whether it is who you know we want to sleep more wanting to not not the gym isn't close enough to my house the you know it's you got a million reasons now the get a million pieces of friction countless or as they say as the recourse has countless minor incidents the kind you can never really first see combine to lower the general level of performance so that one always fall short of the intended goal and this is very smilacae i earn will power can overcome this friction it varies every obstacle but of course it wears down the machine is well you can see they obviously took that directly from cossets whenever form a takes because war is a human enterprise friction will always have a psychological as well as a physical impact so you're getting warm you are getting worn down by the friction friction is inevitable marine leaders must accept it do everything in their power to minimise it to facts and learned to fight effectively in spite of it what what i one of the things that i really like about this term is that it captures every thing and it turns everything you know it clarifies what you're up against you are not just up against all these little things you're opignerationis and actually i was with a jorona he talked about this book the war of art which i haven't read yet i pressfeeder he does the same thing but what is he called legalistic and so it's the same idea you know you put a name on your enemy you identify them whether it's laziness or sugar or lack of movement or whatever that sing is that's what they do in an it allows you to identify it in be aware of what is happening now speaking of how to overcome that this next part of leadership hers and we already mentioned it will at his omething that i obviously identified as extremely important because it's the driver of flif it's the driver of your discipline is your will to make things happen and it keeps us on the path in don't keep us on the path to victory and i talked about it when i was on the sam harris pot cast and i also talked about it on this regent when they for the live to tell at the solano mark lethe first fell killed my rack and i talked about you know what is it take to win and the most important thing it takes to win is will the will till win so the marine corps goes into a story that's about will and i'm going to read it a sign to defend a three mile mountain pass along the divisions manula line and commanding the only route of approach captain barber took position with his battle weary troops and before nightfall had beginsel up a defence along the frozen snow covered hillside when a force of estimated regimental strength thavage ly attack during the night in flootered heavy casualties and finally surrounding his position following a bitterly fought seven hour conflict captain barber after repulsing the enemy gave assurance that he could hold it supplied by her drops and requested permission to stand fast after orders we swore received to fight his way back to a relieving force after two reinforcing units had been driven back under fierce resistance in attempts to reach the the isolated troops so here was captain balbo with his troops there on this ridge line they hold off the enemy and in they get told her you know what now that you call the door can fight back to our position and he says no no we're not fighting back were to stay here or in a hold this ground and although severely wounded captain barber continued to maintain personal control often moving up and down the lines on a stretcher to direct defence and consistently encourage and inspiring his men to supreme efforts despite the staggering opposition waging desperate battle throughout five days and six nights of repeated onslaughts launched by fanatical aggressors he and his heroic command accounted for approximately one thousand enemy dead in this epistate subzero weather and when the company was relieved only eighty two of his original two hundred and twenty men were able to walk away from the position so vally defended against insuperable odds his profound faith and courage great personal valour and unwavering fortitude which is in other words his will were decisive factors in the successful withdraw of the division from the death trap in the chosen reservoir sector that the will and that shows you what will is capable of i mean when you talk about the subzero temperatures he put you just put people out in subside temperatures for a night that will break most people hum now get a tack on night now stay up there for five days and six nights it's just it's the only thing that can win in that battle is will human will from the same battle lieutenant colonel murray who is commanding the fifth marines at the chosen was eva summed up what was required of leaders and this is a very backful when i read this i personally felt in a state of shock the kind of shock one gets from some great personal tragedy the sudden loss of some one close so he gets in this massagist we feel this guy's the commander of all those marines in the chosen word reservoir and he gets this shock like someone like someone's died and he feels it and then he says my first fight was within myself i had to rebuild that emptiness of spirit in you know i get asked gottest on toward of gotten some direct messages people that ask me about loss they lost people that are close them whether it's guys talking about beating combat or whether it's people that are similiar world and bases or accidents is taken people from them and i think one of the things that of the kind of the the thing that i say to people when they say look this is this is crushing me and i feel horrible and i don't know if on going to be able to get back and and and my first statement is always like of course of course and that is normal it is normal for you to feel that way when you lose people then you could see that this you know retention in combat you went through the same thing that's hard core bad as marine had to go kate i feel this loss and i have to rebuild i asked to rebuild the fight was within himself and so i think that's very important for people that listen as pocosan the military you are going on the battle field and you if you are in a if you're fighting long enough you will have castles and that is one of the things i know when my guide work hilled i felt the same damn thing the horrible wretched emptiness and i knew i had to rebuild it and and so reading this co definitely brings me back to that and it clarifies it when i talked to other people about losing some one that that last that your feeling that emptiness that shock is normal anyone don't think that it's going to just disappear you've got a rebuild it you got a rebuild that spirit and so this may ogotay for leaders to hold units together under adverse conditions they first must fight and win the battle within themselves and that's not met okina is this man will packing that is the marine corps talking about leading marines they know that there's a battle going on within you that there's a battle you've got a fight every day that there's a spirit that's got a bee rebuilt when it's broken down this is what combat is this is what war is and this is what life is it goes on to talk about the difference between peace time and combat leading in combat is vastly different from leading in peace time anybody can give orders to have them obeyed at a peace time poster station there nothing blocks the way to wieden the brig meeting jail pay reductions and emotion may be all the incentive necessary to instill good order and discipline but execution of orders in combat may mean immediate danger or even the likelihood of getting killed the marines the marine needs to know why and orders given and how it is to be a executed we talk by his all the time people got in the wider doing what they're doing and i'll tell you the first section of that bearings don't be like that but ringing saying hey you will do this or i'll send you the brig rock you pay reduction artemion that that that's not how leadership for in didnot that way in the rico course those are there nayled them but you don't want to lead like that you don't want to leave with beatings i above all marine teetotal that the leader giving the order knows what he or she is about even giving the best trainings how marines perform will depend on the kind of leadership they had by the example and courage demonstrated by their leader napoleon said there are no bad regiments only bad colonels which is very interesting and is a very common statement that napoleon said and on knowe falter weed on the the about face on this cause david hackworth says there's no bad units only bad officers and then lay for nineteem ownership we have there is no bad teams only bad leaders titantic there's no bed students that only bad teachers so there's no besungen bad instructed ratlike the same rise the same thing it's the same thing and you know from napoleon to hack work to lay for i saying that ah what the marine corsagere a unit led by an able and aggressive leader of gressie leader who commands respect because he set the example and demonstrated courage and confidence well perform any task asked of them motometers not most of the tasks not the easy task any task aggressive leader who commands respect because he set the example and demonstrate couraging confidence will perform any task asked of them that what leadership is about now we get into the moral challenge armies of superior numbers have been put to flight before one man out of ten is fallen they went out beaten by blows which became more than flesh could bear they were beaten in spirit according to laws as old as the human heart and the victor is the one who can best apply those laws so you can have a great huge force a much bigger force and they can break before any one even been killed or when of only a few people have been killed because their spirit is broken when people conduct wives built on high moral standards and physical fitness they tended develop qualities that produce inspired leadership and discipline it is not a new notion it could be found in any great military force in the past dining moral essendine requires that subordinate feel that their leaders genuinely care for them that they are fighting for a word the cross and insuring that their sacrifices are not made in vain i talk about that one rankly year your people have got a no that you not think that you care about em they got a note that you care about him that's what leadership is your leading this group because you care about this group acting as a buffer to protect supported is a key responsibility of any leader leaders must have void passing the buck leaders must if necessary act from the courage of their own convictions even when such a position runs counter to the policy of seniors we talked about that last i remembered napoleon said that if if your fall in my orders that you get a bunch of guys killed it's your fault your colour capable physitian you live you will bade my batter at you your fault it's the same thing that's being said there even when a position runs counter to the policy of seniors leaders must always accept full responsibility for their actions ellore andron as a right there leaders must always accept for esposito for actions for their actions and i like you said extremist's what our books about trying to make that at the utmost level of responsibility is to own everything that's happening we guardless of whose it fall who might be at fault one of their factors one in played doesn't matter take ownership of it all now even the physical challenge the physical demands of battle in compass more than being fit and these demands influence both the leader and the led the effects of sleep depravation poor diet poor high gene and motioned portly fear have to be understood and be a part of every day training no one is immune to fatigue as marines become increasingly tired they may lose the ability to make rapid decisions and are susceptible to being confused distorting to and ultimately in effective guts and pride are not a substitute for fitness and the one a one place where that becomes completely evident is in mixmaster where you get guise they got a lot of gods and they got a lot of pride but a youthink is first is never to a cap and conceited get broken down and fatigues in you know a fatigue makes cowards of us all frasi's not a substitute so gutenbert a substitute for fitness there are good augmentis and but they odont take the place of it a leader relying on gods and pride will not be able to fully concentrate on the mission or the task at hand exact limits of endurance cannot be determined but physical conditioning is one method of reducing the effects of physical exertion and it can increase individual self confidence and reduced dress so how we tell people to work out the way you got to get up and go because it increases individual self confidence it reduces stress in produces the effect of hyson i just got so many benefits ye that that i think the most important is that it reduces the effects later so you know i fear in shape your heart strong ere your mind is strong because they've worked out your whole life or or just your just indefinis you you perform there is his manner heard the thing where it was an article i read where it said well why exercise is the most important part of business in um and the whole thing was it you know it's a left the whole thing was exercises the only thing that affects every other part of your life the only thing so you can have all these other trades and you know the end soothey might affect one thing most in donating thing they disinfect out one thing like if you have money olof money and that effects like excisi but exercise will affect your billy to make money it all affect your relationship in affect you fact everything and it's the one thing that does breakout you jump rope set out cattlerange it on he ashy that's why if you're ever if you ever get in a relationship where the girls like all you know you you put the gamer dogdor something before me that's a red flag red flag in red slanting break up with a fagotto rent flag keesar ning yes he is a wonder it's in friction and that's a friction the surete physical development backbone of the physical development of marine leaders must include dealing with the nature natural fear of interpersonal violence which contributes nificently to the fog and friction of combat dealing with the fear of interpersonal violence so i talked about this with sam harris in that is if you be you one of the worst things that happens when somebody gets a salted if they never been had somebody on them grinding on them before and grabbing lemonade smashing them big never had that feeling before there already way behind rather a way behind cause they're just not used to it it's completely new to them yet whereas obviously some one that trains he intarsia are like you get where you're greeting ground on and people are smashing you you're used to it yet part of your view it's party arrife an and you and you've been in actual fire fight but that's why getting getting some sort of a gun trick gun training or fire on straining is good because if you've never shot a gun before and you fire it you don't watch a movie and stuff does not repair you for how loud that is and i like just the just the impact on your old your whole thing in owen when you fire a gun so if that would happen in some stressful situation someone attacks your some one fires a gun in your presence in it you know this commotion just dealing with the stackage was fired alone is like this huge battle that you have to tational lost cause you no egscuse to it that is a hit you know you need to innoculate yourself to the situation yet and we will actually talk about that a little later to night came and you nitrate leaders that do not have the men to and physical strength to overcome fear will not be able to fight effectively and overcome friction in fact one of the greatest sources of friction is physical exertion and it may be required of individuals units or both and again the physical exertion thing you know we we do at at the gym we do charteris so guys got a fight coming up or a guy's got a tournament coming up and so we put him in the middle and there getting fresh guys you know every two minutes one minute sometimes for minutes sometimes five minutes depending on what they're going into but you can watch and see a total destroyer of a guy after they reached that breaking point just get mopped up and again we're taking them there for a reason you know we're taking a mere thecoe do have to rely on their technique and so they do get conditioned and enoculation against that breaking point and on how to dig ivan deeper the but you can get any one there you can get any one so physically exhausted that there no longer capable of you know do even the slight percentage of what they would normally be capable of m so you have to maintain that conditioning at the highest level all the time that you can and that's like the man really like your saying it it's not just the physical could physical conditioning your conditioning them to the situation like but isan when there be on their physical penetrating point where they they don't have all their strength they run the the the point where you feel like stopping going beyond that point if you rarely or never been beyond that point once you get there you your completely done tersenesses you can pushpot's little more but you think there is yes you get conditioned to it in your ready for ye the gain in moral force deriving from all forms of physical training is an unconscious gain yet i actually think it's not just nonconscious going too i think when i get when i train i feel better my feel stronger i feel sharper will power determination mental poise and muscle control are all march hand in hand with the general health and well being of the individual so again according to the marine corps that this physical training increases your will power your determination your mental poise your must control clearly as you stated earlier physical training is important across the board establishing and maintaining standards maintaining this attitude and standard of excellence is a responsibility not limited to officers staff non commission officers or non commissioned officers it is the responsibility of all marines that's the attitude jonah your team with your company with your business that that attitude of excellence and maintaining the standard of excellence isn't responsibility just of belides is the responsibility of every one leadership in the long run depends upon the example set by the leader not only as a war fighter but also as a citizen and a human being so telegas to display a high level of i'm not sure what the right word is a high level of bearing a high level of presence in all situations in just as a marine but in all levels setting a personal example requires high moral standards reflecting virtue honor patriotism and subordination personal behaviour and in performance these innerquharity es that marked leaders leasear the interpolity that marked meters rather than outward marks of greatness they are often deeply buried and in many cases one must look closely to see in individuals innersent tiger not always going to see is not always got beaten his chest that's the obovate and as an example of that here major general john a lagune described mental vannerie sergeant major john h quick perhaps of all the marines i ever knew quick approached more nearly the perfect type of non commissioned officer a calm forceful intelligent loyal and courageous man he was i never knew him to raise his voice loses temper used profane language and yet he exacted and obtained prompt and explicit obedience from all persons subject to his orders the image of the marine barking orders you have to balance that you have to balance that with the reality of the the example just given made sarcoma jonqui in the marine corps we are trained to endure combat violence and death along with other less arduous situations in both peace and war simply because we bear arms and wheeled awesome power we do not have limitless afore unleasht without do requirement we may not say as one enemy commander said kill all burn all destroy all so again the image and he startit of a marine or vaumerland soldier has to be balanced with the facts of litherally are and that is that they are trained that they don't have limitless of tory unleash the awesome power without due requirement now of course we these are human beings and there are military people in the brine court army seal teams in special operations that govern and that some tota gets guiltless some not sitting here claiming that this is a you know a perfect situation but i am giving you the ideal that the maricourt self sets out upon its marine of what it wants their mares to be lit in and a good we we actually you to say this in the old ames well and this is how do you figure out when something is like gither ght thing to do do the right thing cause sometimes do in the right thing is opposed to what you're being ordered to do or what the rules are if you an prepared to talk about your actions or lack thereof in front of a national audience made up of all your seniors peers subordinates and friends who share the same professional values and whose opinions you value then your behaviour was or is probably ethical in nature so when you're doing something if you salgado you know cable moved to morrow and in a deep reef everybody would i did hum and if you can be proud of it then it was ascanio are going to be hangin your head to the it wasn't a good decision and you warn't doing the right thing and that is definitely something that i used to guide my judgment and because that again the the rules are not always what they should be in man or whether rules they don't fit over the situation that you are and loristan thing and so sometimes the wolves that have been put in place for one region they don't work in the region urnans you have to say okay you don't want by the book they they could burn me on this one but i can look whoever's charging me and save this is what i did and this is why i did it and if you want to send me to the two levenworth for that get out the hand cuffs and looks go this is a power for this is a powerful a paragraph about the red yo'all if you listen to the discantation asshatas sam harris this is just a this is a little bit of a different spin on bravery and on courage courage can be misunderstood it is more than the ability to overcome the jitters to quell fear to conquer the desire run it is the ability to know what is or is not to be feared and infantry chap an infantry men charging a bunker is not hampered by the fear that he might be struck down a few paces from his fighting hole a pilot is not afraid of losing all hydraulic power in his hair cinara t they are both prepared for those outcomes a marine in battle fears to scraching himself by running he fears not losing his life but losing his honour he may not be able to procure his life but he can always preserve his honour that much is within his power to fear disgrace but not death to fear not duty but dereliction from duty this is kurage the truly courageous do not live in anxiety from morning to night they are calm because they know who they are then that last two sentences about the truly courageous do not live in anxiety from morning to night they are calm because they know who they are and i definitely when i hear that statement i think about the guys that i know that were truly courageous and how they did have that a most peaceful added tude of acceptance because they knew who they were and they knew what they would do if the moment came for em another type of more kind of overt turne here from major jim crow for merlested man marine gunner distinguished riflemen star football player was a tower of strength throughout the battle his trade mark of red mustache bristling a combat shot a gun cradled in his arms he exuded confidence and professionalism quality sorely needed on that long day crow ordered the cocon of his landing craft put this god damn boat in the boat had the reforested sending them renestine quickly recovering crores men over the sides then led them through several hundred yards of shallow water reaching the shore in fact only for minutes behind the last wave crow clenching a ciganas teeth and standing upright growling it as men look the sons of bitches can't hit me why do you think they can hit you get moving go red beach three was in capable hands kind of a larger than life a larger than life image of courage adaptability adaptability has long been our key to overcoming the effects of friction and its components although it is synonymous with flexibility adaptability also embraces the spirit of innovation marines constantly seek to adapt new tactics organization and procedures to the realities of the environment deficiencies and existing practices are identified outdated structure discarded and modifications made to maintain function and utility that's something you might want to do in your life deficiencies in existing practices are identified outdated structure discarded and modifications made to maintain function and utility yes go ahead no tself the ability to adapt a naples marines to be comfortable within environment dominated by friction we decocted about an ovation innovation has always been a key component of marine courtoisie and our style of leadership it isn't it is come naturally because our combatant function was and is unique innovation requires that leaders listened to their subordinates amintha again innovation requires that leaders listen to their subordinates and that of two ways system of communication is maintained corporals sergeants captains and generals all have responsibility to be enervators that everybody in your chain command has a responsibility to be innovation al because innovation is imprecise and because subordinate especially junior ones will make mistakes protect them zero defects are not a standard of measurement they do not encourage initiative they stifle so your junior folks and some of your junior leadership and maybe some of your senior leadership there going to make some mistakes and you got a protectin and encourage him to continue on to try to be innovative from if we wish to think at wearily you wish to free your mind if you wish to think clearly we must cease imitating if we wish to cease imitating we must make use of our imagination how often is it that you see a marine in his dread service dress blue uniformed looking like a statue of perfection how often is it you think that there manwill tells them that they have to make use of their imagination you know people don't get that image and i said this before and i'll say it again combat is an absolute exercisin creativity that's what it is and you got to use your imagination we must train ourselves for the unexpected in place of training others for the for the cut and dried audacity and not caution must be our watchword got takes some risks got it takes some risks now here is a term badges like as a matter of fact oreus the awork i love mister the term is fighting power fighting power is an organizations ability to conduct combattans by overcoming challenges to lead compete and prevail on the battlefield fighting power rests on mental intellectual and an organizational foundations in its manifestations in one combination or another are disciplinants morale and initiative courage and toughness the willingness to fight and the readiness if necessary to die fighting power in brief is the fine as the sum total of mental and physical qualities that make armies fight an you know what i just added something in their connaturall says mental qualities that make or refitting mental in physical qualities cause we've talked about the physical qualities and how important is fighting power in brief is that fine as the sum total mental and physical qualities that make army fight make or misfit in one i like about this idea of fighting bower is what in you do to improve your fighting power to day what can you do is what you doing helpful are you moving it forward are you increasing your fighting power are you degusi it are you going backwards that's the real question arm and i think that when you realize that what you do in your life is either doing one or two things it's either increasing your fighting power or decreasing your finding polini you're staying stagnant your your basically don't backwards on and here is a a little rap up here's the uh leadership princes be technically and tacitly proficient no yourself and seek self and provement boom no your marines and look out for their welfare keep your marines informed set the example and sure the task is understood supervised and accomplished train your marines as eighteen make sound and tiny decisions develop a sense of responsibility among your subordinates little decentralized command employer unit in accordance with its capabilities seeson ibility and take responsibility for your actions once again ownership and i like the secessit in a little little seal salissait we used to have was a look for work so there is nothing a long look for work man when you say a new sea new guy standing there an not knowin what do e go look for work means go pick up scary position go help move bodies go do something make something happen secretent in this last statement is just a note to remind everybody of the troopers on the front lines throughout history the time always comes in battle when the decisions of statesmen and of generals can no longer affect the issue and would its not the power of our national wealth to change the balance decisively victory is never achieved prior to that point ain only be one after the battle has been delivered into the hands of men who move in imminent danger of death her nets as alamosa before on the front lines so forever on outbeatenes that all the foine right now i salute you all let's get to the questions at all gaities ion from dark thirty one eleven will you guys cover it injury recovery and the mentality to quick recovery and advice out of fine physical limit without injury okay i so from for the son will first of all train hard but always transmarine don't do things that are going to her you and necistate just like everything else you have to push yourself hard enough that you yet stronger but at the same time you can peese so hard that you get injured so i think that one of the keys another keys making sure you take adequate rests which of course i'm usually guilty of not doing that being said when you see me training every day i'm not you know i'm not going a hundred and ten per cent every day there's some days where i ronte gym and i say ye k this is not at this not diffuse myself on the injury prone to day you know and so i i will take her my work out and i'll outdo it some other kind of intensity but let's say i'm not canalis heavy weights or i'm not going to sprint because i'm feeling tight and at one of pomologist you got a listen to what your body saying another thing that i think is important about it is you we talked about on the last podcast is you know changing your goes and costly chasing after different cousinot for ah a dead lift and then you're going for a mile time run and the you're going for number oposit your your constantly kindashon's and i think that it is a good way to avoid injury because you're not just hammering the same thing over and owenton which i think leaves injuring now ithabel said you you don't ever want unjustice stop you don't elements of your work out you know you want to keep that's why it's ditson not go in these extreme directions and i'll tell you one i want i think is the most important thing for me for being relatively injury free and a outalisso my injuries all the next question but relatively injury free is that i always work out i always work out and i think that when people go i think what people take a stenebras a diamond by the i think i mean you know you're starting to get into like two weeks three weeks may be a month of not doing anything i think when people come back from those tiswin they get injured as when they get her because their body's just it still strong it's still thinks it can do what it did in three weeks ago but i can't it's not conditioned for it and that's when that's when you get her a another good piece i think for recovery and is the samogitia the kelly kase dar you know go to ability at dot com and just look at that look at what he's doing look always putting out he's got some great stuff to hell yourself then in square way your injuries i think stretching i think stretching is important but i think people take it to an excess and i think will you do too much of it i think it's i think it's causes problems um i know as i know some some guise it of done extreme yoga and i think extreme yoga is you don't want your once you go beyond what is normal or a little beyond normal you start to injure yourself and i think that's not good tinkeles do you know joint laxity will your your your joints can actually move too much and then there's not enough holding them in place and there the filtering and so i think just listened to your body and i think that the next part i question will answer in the next question but tis that canna add to that indecision as he well it ondootedly if they're trying to cut up her or or drop some weight and you know you're training for something you got to make weight that you know that's going to be a little bit more specific strategy but lotembwa starve them self ye i'm always found people like when they are feeling negative in a feelie their interpretation people there probably lacking fats they're probably lacking good fat you know yes so i agree with you dies streaming borden yeah an what like when you when you were on this wailing early on an un understanding the importance of this i think really really helped is if you eat right after you work out don't don't think that you're going to eat a meal in that's gonna feel your work out because it's like it takes a while for the the calories to go into your system he you will work out i sat on to do it in like an hour solely so go work out an eat after so that those calories and in those neutrons will help your body recover and within that hour that's when your body wants to recover or wants us entry and sails so doing that if you starve yourself or don't eat or eat very little you you must learn on to be recovered your tenants in an be a little bit more weak even when you do recover in taking those new treats you so you will be in more prone i probably i probably need to do better job that is you well i people always ask me an i i get done work on out you know what like five or six well maybe six o'clock in the morning of one worth now and i usually don't i usual don't eat until i entertain you know so i probably new to better job with that i'll yet take achochre the advice about one melasome that's funny but i open mind so its cool i can do that ye good in the body millyun moral death like a no grainer the out the anabolic window and it's like you could see little jokes on it where it's like a junk in bacon all he muses anabolic window and it so the picture of like a guy holding a diging or so or it's like it's a rolleport thing and it helps so much well gartha into next question from what honey bees do a one it's all one word it's just kinoshitagawa what honey do you think you're not on the dicotyles squashville these do you don't care be that ye lanahan eyes do you never have had it these you what the honey bees do what onriest what honey beaten the unsimulated geo what injures have you got him in how did you adopt a she obviously active life style you know growing up and spending my life in the seldens conover's from everything and of o'han encerro sprang ankles shoulders wrists lower back elbows but the most serious actual injury at i had um was had neckhankercher and a for amaotome in my neck which as they go in and they scraped some bone away from the frame which are bad when they did it and but it's the really good um i was real i i i have like lost movement in my arm for a little while my right on from your neck from my neck into rehua just grinding over time and and you know i remember there's one part of seal training where your carrying the spot to your head which is not that big of a deal but then the instructors would jump from boat to boat gets two hundred pound instructors and and there is jumping their both on your head and their young in from boat to boat and i it's i remember and instructor jumping into the boat landing pretty much were i was and i remember hearing a grinding noise in my neck and i you know course i was nineteen years old so it acarryin on it but if a they don't they don't do that any more that actually don't jump from boat to boat or which is which is cool they shouldn't cause is not good for you be so but when he was with all these injuries whether it's my all terror whether it be a high ankle sprains and in all kinds of ligament damages in my in my ankles and my lower back which i've been reda few times mode almost all muscular there ah what i do is i do the same thing with all them and that is i do whatever i can you know if i if i hurt when i hurt my knee and i couldn't squaw i could do like a quarter squat and i did a quarter squat you know i'd go up the garage and i'd stand there with nobody wait and just do quartershot and get the blood moving and you know that i trying to my other body parts and you know could you poupin so i did deadandgone even move my need is like kitanda i did what i could there you know so you can't do ring dips do regular deponent do dips to push if you can't do push on push off of a wall whenever it takes to get something done can't lift that forty kilogram kennebee the twenty four kilogram cattle bell just do something move get the blood and there and i was to get the blood in her cairistine that that more your moving in the more you're using that range emotion the the faster you're going to heal you know you're just circulating more repairing nutriantur your body so it would make sense to me that that's going to help you heel now of course you can read the image you can go worse you know if if it hurts do a quarter squat and so you do have squat your your going backwards you know sir you want to stay within the range motion we are not windring it or making a worse so don't be stupid but do get the movement going and also i don't know what i would do mentally if i won couldn't do anything at all now when i hurt my back though i was i was laid up i didn't think i was going to be i was monsoor through it and then adopt guy ye no i was laid up with my dadanoscara and but i'll tell you as soon as i could get up and start trying to walk around i did it and she like i said try to try to stay sane and then the other thing that happens is when you have these injuries you know you're you got to adapt our goals you know when you got to cut a set o goes o hay you know and and really i've never really fully regained his strength in my right arm and my right packened as strong as it was and it's definitely way weaker than my other side you was probably at seven the ray per cent a and well i just have to say okay well what can i do it's like okay you're going to be nor a normal human now ye hoses yours what hers years were you and no gold or am you know i'm still trying to improve and get better and whatever it is but you know injuries or gunhae in life and you got a dodoothat to work through him as smartly as you possibly can and kennett the the the trained smart it this may seem obvious but when you do like higher ratlike heavier weight or not i rotary heavier weight and um larruper explosive stuff you're going to be more pronando so even being just more conscious of your movements to and and really avoiding those types of movements when you feel an injury carteloise a little lower back thing or or a shoulder clung for sure am i just be conscious of your movement teramore today i was dead lessing and i i was a onotoa where dandenong for the day i and and you don't i i definitely spared myself being laid up you know and i just got out the roller and just grounded out for a while dodoneaean it out for a while but for sure you got to listen you got to pay attention and what if you feel that little twin shouls no big deal you know jest plenty of other ways to get your tegitur out on besides jack in the big steel so yet you em like or you think you bodywashers you know like if you if you had a six what work out planned and you feel your lower back or your it then is a very one where it when you when you get after it in squatted at times act up fwhistle sick now triforia months ago and it i couldn't do it was weird to one of those weird things i couldn't do overheads but i could do a lord's rosinante i snatch yes i couldn't do over at squantown for whatever reason the but i could do from squattering spots and i couldn't go to fool that the ones i could still go to foot up on again out on know why i'm not a physician one wants felt the best so i started to more and more front squattee and then eventually you know the man now a back to do in everything so figure out what you can get away with figure out what you can do and knew it also on niners to being conscious of like your movement a lot times i know this this is a case for me where i'll get little injuries from just like raking or unrecking weight just because it's like all rayonnement nal turning my firdoos get in jeanieville thing you know because that a lot of times that is like its unconscious on a just put their hoverhear you know in your not one meanwhile if he do a clean and jerk you like o kamina fill in on this good technique or alas so again that goes along with being careful of your moat movement being being can on trust ye not to ashley when you feel when you hit that fate when you know you've been working out for a three weeks straight hard very little rest you're on the now and you start to feel these little things come about a thing it's important to to to be conscious though yeatman also to what you were saying earlier if my head's not in a game i'm not jack an did they wait yes you've got to be thinking about it you got to be sinking by your body position you know before you do before you before you just try gravel as big wait throw around you you got to get you hanagan it next question oh this is actually my question a cousin for acoomin with the question from someone else ye yes yes sister will they to public speaking right how did you like i've seen all to some of our speeches how did you get good at it because that's a that's a daunting nerve racking thing in it like some people they prefer death over public speaking literally as that have so what her um what's your mind set you know for keep you from from being nervous and in that that's coupled with another question here right which we got him diference fear in general bright acervaline if your rejection or the unknown um what would your advice be to some one who wants the lake start a business or major project um but there but there held back by fear so this is again is interesting for me because public speaking he is not something that induces fear me it never has a but i know that it does make people scared and i think that overcoming the key to any overcoming any fear in my mind is we ought rather laertes inoculation and this idea and i actually looked up the definition of inoculation and its the introduce introduction of a passage in her and to gin into a living organism to stimulate the production of antibiotic into by this so you given yourself a little bit rerange yourself a little bit and you build on monferrand and that's what you do you take the small doses so it prepares you for the big bigger uses an a one of my daughters my little daughter she was really wanting to be in the school play right and other plays around town and in all caecae that's cool but she was horrified to god front of an audience all ivied and so i looked up and i said okay how do you stop your kids from being getting stage fright is one that all it and you know i read about people what they did and what i did was i said i seratok ah the singers on for me and it's not that beguilesome bad thing as you think so for me and even that she be a little bitten barabul she thinks him for it and then then you know a couple of days at an my wife have sing that song for both of us and then it was on my wife's got friend of her hay sing that song for the three of us because i got a mystery person then unknown in the room a acoming at her and each time she giving a little bit more more complex because we took her to a wondher called try outs with triumphal ought dish he addition we took her to a couple of unison to where it was her turn and she didn't go she broke down to crying and justice just couldn't handle it mum and so then it was he that it was a few my wife's friends rover then it was some of my friends were over snowy got you know gus and girls and each time she got more and more confidence and eventually she just in carry more and she was totally confident and she got the lead role in his school as easilie got the leader on wise so she was able to overcome that fear and in the selfesteem kind of thing we don't whether you're going to get a noculation against stress as much as they construct you out in the supineness you out there is going to be machine gun fire you're going to be used to that there's an explosion going off you go to use that last to do we do flied fire machine gun drills and and and ah i add drills immediate action dress will you maneuvering around we did that without our pair protection and sometimes so you get used to this corey banging we don't do that any more because it's not smart but ah but you do that to innoculate like what you were talking about earlier when that gun goes off he should be completely comfortable with it and there's a a one of my favorite stories on that when my first are both one of one of the a a buddy of mine who actually took my job i was a task a commander he actually took my job as task commander and a flash bang isn't grenade that you throw into a room before you go into the room and it makes a loud explosion and smoke and then it allows you to enter in on the room when the people that are inside now startled and so having advantage well occasionally you know you have to open the door to throw the the crash and there and educationally some one will open the door and some one will run in by the greeting coronate it well and so the open the door girondin and then some one throws the crash into no your crashing yourself oh is not that big of dely got a used to it but what happened with one of his new guys you know that happened so the door went open there guy went in and i while the guys runnin in some trosachs in that the guy seized the crash and he runs back out of the room and which is not which is both to do so this guy was the taste center he is a come of me down there and so they walked down in the ebroin a closet in the kill house and just sat in there and said ye how'st going and they just sat there in the dark and drop like eight crashes at her feet and dismissing cause he realized you just got to get inoculated ear you just gotta overcome it so the kind of i guess my my theory here would be if you are afraid of fighting and altercations go trying to get to her afraid of heights work on some rock claiming climbing if you are afraid of the water time to swim he timed to serf is trying to get out there your friend a pull up if if you're fraid o polesdean fastusque if you're afraid of public speaking those speak in public he if you're afraid to start a business sport a business make it small in our ones which you have do yet to mitigate the risk and you have the easier self into it but you got a go for it and eventually you will over come that fear humbug the hard part is you got to take that first step and you've got to take that first step to begin to noculations against the fear against the fear of the thing that's in your mind because i feared generally is in your mind that you know when you get up on stage to public speaking people are not going to throw tomatoes at you and say oh my yearning off the stage alright thirty then there it there you know so there's nothing to fear yes it's in it's in your head hitless grenades they don't cause any damage to people that joke gominy don't like want em next to your eye there rained and they make a big boom and the explosive but yet they don't they don't ever you red generally the days you they ate men days they study ye the like what if i had one in like a pocket and it went off there you'd get little you get little some not an i get hurt not injured you get yet you get hurt condoglia or some three ayistree ye i never let enoff in my pocket he always wondered what those because they right next question am okay and pagasae seven you answer a question which was the sentially about how a subordinate might cope with a leader who was not competent and um so this this person is interested in your thoughts on the opposite side of the point for example if you are in that dicuntur you know it how can you still lead a team effectively given the lack of competent um the given the lack of competent cannoned the hinstrument confidence in you so so the question as you are that guy yes you're a a guy that does have the knowledge you're the guy that's an experience you the guy that just got hired that's good that he know it that's good reaective recognizing that as it is step number one he's recognized that he is the guy that he's in experience is never known to set her so this this question while it might seem like a tough question it's actually one might think because competence and knowledge definitely are very beneficial for leadership that the knowledge peace and unannoying the technical side of what your trying to lead a teaman but it is definitely not man to him now if you don't have it of course you should strive to get it because it will make you a better leader but in certain situations there is times where you have to lead and you have to lead now that does happen so what do in how you eat when you are in addition and it's actually pretty easy you lead almost the age zacate you way that you would in any other situation humbly and with an open mind so leadership is the same regardless of what you know think about it leadership is the same regards of what you know what you're going to do as you're going to gather ideas cause you don't really haven't you don't you eaether them from the other people right you to explore the different messages right cause you don't know i the other method so you just can explore tell how would you do it how would you do it oh you in a way the different courses of action because you're not sure which one is going to be vested not goin to be super evident which course of access on me the best you're going to listen listen to what people are saying you're gonna keep an open mind any here what they're saying you're going to show that year a quick learner and you're going to listen and learn and how do you show that your quick larner you show your quick one by being a quick learner and how do you be a quick one by studying a silk when it comes winter stuff that you should know then you study it and you learn it and you prove and then you take all this information that you've got and you weigh did this vision and he make one and again that's how you should be leaving anyways right so as omasius because you know them most right if you are the most knallerbsen team does that mean you replantation no no it doesn't testator going make your decisions in a vac you by yourself just now if you are a good leader you not going to do that at all is it men you're gonna make decisions and move for without consulting with people no it doesn't so all this means is that you're going to do all the things you are gonna get consent is from the group you're going to get people on board you're goin to talk to an ass you at their derides are and again i i shouldn't ave used the word consensus you can always lead by confesses that can be that can become difficult but you're going to listen you're going to learn you're goin to talk to people about what you're doing and that's how you're going to lead again it's almost exactly the only thing that gets added if you are sort of a technique for tis you can be a little bit more of a sanity check on you know what's she a plan that people are coming up with if if if we were doing a computer you know software engineering problem mum i i would not be able to add my technical exotics but if you don't for of the com the engineers came to me and presented what their ideas were i'd be able to look at a logically seepin me out to ask enough questions until i said okay guys here's we'm thinking her say i think we should go with you know method whatever and the other people can find a count or in the eventually we can make that decision happen so the f i had the knowledge myself that i could make that this iobates not cold add a little bit of a sandy check but it's not life and death no ah and the other in that interesting is wing you do have the knowledge yourself you can you can actually come off as a note all which is not a good leader so in both cases whether you are the technical expert or whether you're not the leadership principle stay the same be humble be open minded listen learn and let laghetto what is your greatest weakness and what are you doing to work through or around it what is my gratis weakness my biggest weakness and has actually heard a question because when i think about it frankly i am nothing but weakness i'm not naturally strong i'm not naturally fast i'm not naturally flexible i i'm certainly not the smartest guy in the world and and i get emotional over stupid things and i eat the wrong food and i don't sleep enough i procrastinate i waste time and i care too much about stupid things and not enough about important things and of course my ego is too big but the same time i mind is too small and it's trapped and sideits muno that being said i i vasa and it's any probably heard me say it before a person strength are often their biggest weaknesses into that also means that their weaknesses can be their strength so me i am weak in all those ways that i listed i am weak but i don't accept that i don't accept that i am what i am and that that is what i am doom to be no i don't accept that i'm fighting i'm always fighting i'm struggling and i'm scrapping men kaingin at those weaknesses the change them stop them some days i went some days i don't but each in every day i get back up and i moved forward with my fist clenched toward the battle toward the struggle and i fight with everything of god to overcome those weaknesses and those short false and those flaws as i strive to be just a little bit better to day than i was yesterday and i think that not about wraps it up fortunit and like we always say if you want to continue this conversation or you want to engage in one or you want to hang with us virtually you can find us on twitter
